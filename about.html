      <h1 class="header">INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p class="general_text">
        Welcome to Sybest and thank you for using our services.
        To introduce what Sybest is, Sybest will like to talk about data science.
        Data science is a tool that analyze big data and create insights or stories within that data.
        Without data, data science wouldn't exist in the first place. Currently in Silicon Valley,
        big companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google are hiring data scientists to make predictions,
        insights, and patterns using big data. For example, Facebook monitors your behavior by collecting
        data of your actions on Facebook application and predict which type of advertisements you will
        be interested in. Thus, Facebook can bring more revenue on their side just by analyizing you.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header">What is Sybest about?</h1>
      <p class="general_text">
        Sybest is all about individuals within our society. Our goal is to make advanced tools, such as data science,
        available and accessable to anyone who needs this benefit. Currently in Silicon Valley, the average costs
        to hire one data scientist is $170,000 dollars a year. Due to high cost, any ordinary people don't have
        money to hire data scientist. Currently, only big corporations use data science to increase profit and revenue.
        Data science is also known as artificial intelligence because it can predict future using data.
      </p>
      <p  >
        Sybest has a main business goal. We believe that everyone, your neighbor or friends, should be able to know
        what data science and artificial intelligence is, and how is it being used currently that will help any businesses.
        Sybest believe that only big corporations have monopoly in data science market.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header">Okay, why do I need data science?</h1>
      <p>
        Let us do some analysis for you. We use script and automation based on your restaurant name or keywords.
        Then we have an automated machine that scrapes the data of your restaurant reviews from Google and Yelp website.
        Here are the general analysis Sybest got for you. After seeing our analysis, you will notice the power of having data
        and using data science and analysis tool to analyze the current situation and behavior of your business.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header">Negative Vs. Positive</h1>
      <canvas id="pieChart" height = "100px" width: "100px" margin: "auto"></canvas>
      <p>
        The above figure is a pie chart of your restaurant reviews we collected from different sources. Please hover your
        mouse around the pie graph to see the details in the chart. It is good to know how many negative reviews and positive
        reviews you have on your restaurant. It tells you if majority of the people or customers like your restaurant.
        Every dish that comes back from customers doesn't really say if they really liked it or not. People use social media
        like Yelp and Google to leave true reviews.
      </p>
      <p id="pie_description"></p>
      <p>
        We also have a trend graph that tells you when you got the negative reviews and positive reviews. If you click the
        <a href="line_graph.html">Learn More</a>, you will notice the trend of what time you got certain reviews at certain month
        or time.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header">Keywords in reviews</h1>
      <p>
        Not only we can collect your reviews and total number of reviews, Sybest can also do insight analytics by looking into
        keywords in both positive and negative categories. As you can see below bar graph, it shows the most repetitive words.
        The first word in the list shown in the bar graph is the most used word in your reviews.
      </p>
      <canvas id="negBarChart" height="150px" margin="auto"></canvas>
      <p>
        Below are the keywords that we found from positive reviews. You can track which keywords are mostly used when people comment about
        your restaurant or business. It is great to see what reviews customers are writing about.
      </p>
      <canvas id="posBarChart" height="150px" margin-"auto"></canvas>
      <p>
        Okay.. We know that looking at these keywords don't bring you deep insight of what each customer like about your restaurant
        or don't like about your restaurant. That's okay because this is just a high level view of your comments and keywords.
        The above graph is a graph to demonstrate which keywords are you looking for within all reviews that customers wrote about
        your restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to look deep into individual commnets, please go to the <a href="search.html">Search Section</a> to search the desired
        keywords. There will be instructions on how to use those search engines we provided for you to do deep insight analytics.
