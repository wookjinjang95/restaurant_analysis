        <p>
          Sybest isn't just about generating data and bringing profit or revenue for any local business owners.
          This is just one of the step we are trying to prove that the future technology such as artificial intelligence,
          and machine learning should be accessable to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, big corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are using your information through monitoring and tracking
          your inputs. Everytime you search or click, these big corporations save those data and use artificial intelligence or
          machine learning to generate profits and revenue. You might not think this is not a big deal. But it is..
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the <i>Investopedia</i> article, Amazon is putting its flag in the ground of one industry to another with power
          in Artificial intelligence to take over the market. Such companies like BestBuy, UPS, FedEx, Walgreens are in threat by
          Amazon. We are entering into a data industry or data world where without data, there is no system or business. However, no
          individual or a person can afford to have data analysis or data science.
        </p>
        <div class="quote">"Data is for everyone"</div>
        <p>
            Currently, data is being misused in alot of companies. Facebook is one of the example that uses data to control your
            emotions. Depending on what you like and what you hate, Facebook posts something that will invoke your emotions in certain
            ways so that every users stays longer on Facebook. By doing so, Facebook can add more advertisements and that will
            increase more views. More advertisement views from every user, more money Facebook can generate. They say that Facebook
            knows more about you than yourself.
