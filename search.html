        Welcome to the search for searhces section. In here, you can search for keywords within all
        the comments we data mined for you. Below bar graphs will demonstrate what are most words that are used
        or repeated from all comements from different people. If you need to understand what this bar graph

        <p>
          Progress graph will tell you the top 10 keywords being used overall each year. We first find the top 10 keywords
          just like the previous graph. Then, we search those individual keywords in every single comment. It counts how many
          reviews or comments used those keywords. At the end, you get the result of whether those keywords used less, more, or
          still same in your restaurant or local business. To know your progress, please check <a href="line_graph.html">Trend Section</a>
          for more details.
        </p>
        <div class="gb_title">Progress on Keywords</div>
        <p>
          These are the total amount of comments that used the keywords that we defined in the previous bar graph.
          The graph below demonstrates the trend of the top 10 popular keywords in a timeline. Due to the poor data structure
          from Google, we only used Yelp data for visualization. Google doesn't provide us enough time data for Sybest to create
          accurate timeline graph.

          Now we know which words are most being used in both negative and positive comments, you can search those
          keywords below to see the full context of each reviews. Due to data security, we decided not to show who
          person is that left the comment about your restaurant. Apology for inconvenience.

        By looking at the color, you can tell by left side is the positive reviews and right side is a negative reviews.
        Each side of the column has a search text box. There you can search for the keywords and the table will show you
        all the comments that has that keyword. By doing so, you, as a business user, can do some analysis depending on
        which area in your business you want to improve by keywords.
