2019,"My girlfriend decided to take me out to Kiraku for dinner and I was not disappointed. Although the portion sizes weren't the biggest, I felt satisfied with everything we ordered as it really displayed the use of high quality ingredients (freshness + taste) while maintaining a good presentation (plating) of the restaurant's food. Anyone who has been to Japan would probably agree that Kiraku's food is very reminiscent of the food in Japan. Maybe not entirely the same in terms of keeping the food menu traditional, but still close in a sense that you're able to eat such fresh tasting raw fish at their establishment (something most Japanese restaurants have trouble with considering the fact that the availability of fresh fish in the US is harder to come by compared to Japan).

Useful Tip (Must): For people interested in eating at Kiraku, I suggest you come in early and sign you + your party on their waitlist. The restaurant doesn't open until 5:30pm but while the restaurant employees set up they leave an iPad outside of their restaurant for people to sign up for their waitlist. My girlfriend and I got there as early as 4:40pm and we were able to get the first spot on the waitlist. By checking in on their waitlist, it allows you to receive text updates regarding your place in line. As soon as we came back (around 5:10pm) the expected wait time was 91 minutes. So try your best to come earlier than the early people ^^

The establish is really small and they cannot accommodate too many at once. It's recommended that bigger parties reserve a table by calling in a couple of days in advanced or expect to wait a long time. Another reason why the wait is so long is because everything you order does not come to your table all at once because they like to serve their food to customers plate by plate.

No complaints on service, every employee was friendly and informative about their food menu.

Personal Favorites:
Black Pork Belly Skewer w/ Homemade Miso
Tender Beef Tongue Skewer
Wagyu Uni Nigiri
Yuba Spoon

These are all my personal favorites at Kiraku! I don't want to go in too much detail of each dish's flavor because that would only spoil and ruin the experience for everyone. Instead, come out and check it out for yourselves (:

Would I eat here again?
I feel like Kiraku is more of a place you go to only on very special occasion and to me it's more like a place you go to for that one time experience. I admit the food is good but the prices are really high for the portions you receive. It's not a practical place to go to if you're trying to get super full. However, it's a restaurant that everyone should experience.",5.0
2019,"Small hole in the wall izakaya with trendy reggae music playing.

Came here for my birthday! Rave reviews on yelp brought us here. They do sing to you while you eat dessert- but you do have to pay for it, not complimentary.

For the 3 of us we made a reservation and were seated immediately

Excellent quick service--

1 solid star off- too salty for the skewer meat
The albacore ceviche was great but again lime was a tad too much One star off the grilled meat was a tad too salty for our tastes buds.

Good dishes :
Beef tataki
Grilled squid (must order if you like squid)
Chazuke

Servers were so attentive at refilling our tea and water.. much needed given the saltiness of the food.",4.0
2019,"Found this spot on yelp and wanted to try! There was a little wait so we added ourselves on the Yelp waitlist. The service is excellent. Our waitress handed us a warm towel to wipe our hands. The menu is pretty limited so it took my friend and I a little while to ordered. We ordered the Waygu beef tataki, sake sashimi, and chefs special.

The beef tataki was delicious but very thinly sliced. It was good enough for you to taste the texture of it.

Salmon sashimi is fresh, but the amount is a little a skimpy for the cost.

Chef's special was catfish with their home made sauce or some. We ordered some rice to fill us up a little bit.

Great food, great service but need to be more generous with the portion. Street parking can be a little rough. Make sure to check in on Yelp before coming by!",3.0
2019,"I should've known better that Yelp Waitlist is available at many restaurants nowadays and that I should always check before I leave the house. I waited 1.5 hours for a table for 2 on Sunday night, crossing my fingers that I'd be seated before they close at 9. Good thing for me, luck was on my side that day and I was seated with an hour to spare before they closed. Make sure you check-in once you get the text because at one point, I got booted off the waitlist and had to be re-added.

I've heard many great things about this place and I was excited to take my mom to a new restaurant in Berkeley. Fortunately for us, when we started waiting neither of us were hungry. But, by the time we got seated, we were friggin' starving so we obviously ordered way too much food for two people, but hey, BALL OUT.

Kiraku is famous for their high quality tapas or small dishes and they're great for sharing. The price point for items is anywhere between $3-18, more if you're ordering premium daily specials like their sashimi plate. It adds up rather quickly if you're not careful.  

SASHIMI SPECIAL
Comes with 3, 5, or 7 types of fish, one piece each starting at $11.
Super fresh, thick and sweet cuts of fish

SUZUKI CARPACCIO
One of my favorite items of the night, thinly sliced fish with japanese soy sauce, yuzu and sesame oil.

YUZU CHICKEN UDON
Honestly ordered this because I thought we weren't going to be full, but it's pretty basic. Soup is citrus-y and very refreshing. Chicken wasn't anything special.

MINI KAISEN DONBURI
I love all things salmon, ikura, snow crab and uni. It's a cute little Donburi bowl with the best ingredients.

TENDER BEEF TONGUE SKEWER
I love yakitori and one of my favorite pieces has to be beef tongue. Then of course pork belly, cartilage and other fixin's like heart and gizzards. But only tried one this time. If I was more baller, I'd try the Beef Tongue with Truffle Oil. Maybe next time.

JUMBO SQUID
Best grilled squid I've had at a Japanese spot in the East Bay. Perfectly grilled, not chewy at all, flavors were great. Served with teriyaki sauce and a side of Japanese mayo.

SPICY TUNA TARTARE
Prepared Temaki style, so you assemble it yourself. It's served in a little bamboo tube so the presentation of this dish is on point ya'll. It comes with a side of mountain yam, seaweed and other greens. I've never had Mountain Yams before and by itself, it's definitely a little sticky like okra is, but paired with the tuna tartare, it added a very refreshing crunch like a radish. The tartare was a little salty on its own but definitely worked well with the yams and even more delicious if you had a little white rice to add to your seaweed wrap.

I'm pretty sure the servers are Japanese which makes this place even more legit and worth going to. I saw many Japanese customers finish their meal and hug and thank the owner for the friendly service. I love when small places like this are successful and it's obvious Kiraku is very popular amongst locals and even students. Looking forward to dining here again next time, but being smarter about it and checking Yelp waitlist before I arrive!",5.0
2019,"There is always a line. And for good reason.

The food here is amazing. Interesting, quality and well-executed. The menu looks different from any other Japanese restaurant you've been to. Always interesting and delicious - see the pics for what we tried this night.

Service is friendly and consistent. The space is small and compact so noise levels can be an issue, but the food really is worth it. GO. Enjoy.",5.0
2019,"I've heard only good things about this place, and I'm glad I finally tried it! I came here on a Thursday night around 7:15 with my boyfriend. We put our name on the yelp waitlist about 20 minutes before. Here's what we ordered:

Tuna cheek 5/5
Beef tongue skewer 5/5
Chicken karaage 4/5
Corn tempura 4/5
Tsunami sampler with seaweed, squid, octopus 2/5 - it was ok but probably wouldn't order again.

We ate 3 tacos before so we weren't that hungry, but the food was good! There's so much more I want to try. Definitely coming back!

Total for the 2 of us with 2 beers was around $80 after tip.",4.0
2019,"God I wish I went here before I graduated.

Heard so many good things about Kiraku, so finally gathered up a group of friends during our graduation week. Group of 8 came at 5pm to put our names on the waitlist, and we were seated right when they opened at 5:30!

For ease of ordering, we split the table by groups of 4 - my group ordered the corn tempura, jumbo squid, black pork belly, rice ball, chazuke, roasted duck, and finally finished with a dessert of blanc-manger.

Highlights of the night are the jumbo squid and roasted duck - so tender and melt in mouth bursting with flavor. All the other dishes were equally yummy; honestly I suspect any dish you order will be good.

Great service, a bit pricey (paid $40 per person) but definitely worth it. I definitely plan to come back again to try their other tapas.",5.0
2019,"Be prepared to splurge, because the menu has sooooo many good options. You will want to get everything... You have been warned.
Since it's Japanese tapas, you know that the portion is going to be small. For 3 people, order around 5-6 plates, depending on what the plates are. You can spend around $35-60 per person.

My all-time favorite are the grilled black cod, wagyu carpaccio and grilled tongue with truffle oil and sea salt. These three are a must-get. All three are super flavorful. The corn fritters with green tea salt is also great and crunchy. The roasted tea blanc-manger, which I still can't pronounce, is also a good dessert option. It's not super sweet, but it serves as a great palate cleanser.

If you make a reservation, they have a $40 minimum pp, but honestly, you wouldn't have a hard time hitting that. If you don't want to reserve, make sure you come early to put your name down or join the Yelp waitlist. Even if you join the Yelp waitlist at 5.30 (when it opens), you will get in at around 8.30. It's crazy!",5.0
2019,"I had an amazing dining experience at Kiraku! I am only deducting a star because they made us wait over 2 hours even after we had signed up on the waitlist and showed up when the message told us to check in with the host (we still waited an hour after that).

The restaurant itself is super small and kind of like an izakaya, so it was no wonder that the wait was so long. Their food is served on small plates, so do not walk in expecting to have one large dish that will fill you up. The menu has skewers, fried food, and other small plates that complement sake. We ordered a variety of dishes but my favorites were the pork belly skewers, the beef skewer, and the donburi. The pork belly is cut thickly, served with a miso paste and it reminded me of an elevated version of kbbq pork belly. Very tender and flavorful. The beef skewer was even more tender and deliciously seasoned, I would definitely recommend this one to anyone. The donburi is adorable and comes with the tiniest spoon. It is beautiful to look at and the ingredients served are fresh.

The other items we tried were the fried garlic (which also came with a miso paste), fried cartilage, onigiri, and sweet potato brulee. The garlic was not as garlicky as I hoped, so it was just fried batter. The fried cartilage had an interesting texture and was pretty good. The onigiri was probably my least favorite plate out of everything we ordered since I liked the donburi rice better. I think the onigiri could have been grilled a little longer for a more golden crust and texture. The sweet potato brulee was delicious and you can definitely feel the starchy texture and flavor. It is unique and a great end to a fantastic meal.

We ordered some sake and I loved that the employees helped us choose. They had sold out on some that we were interested in trying, but they let us sample a few to choose from the ones they had. I also loved that they let us pick our sake cups! There were so many different little cups to pick from (some cups were larger than others). The cups looked handmade and all had their own designs and quirks. Service was great and the food was a culinary adventure. I would love to come back and try the other items of their menu!",4.0
2019,"Sorry to be the naysayer here, but we dine all over the Bay Area and Kiraku disappointed us. Quality is excellent but portions stingy and concept/execution wasn't remarkable. Service however is excellent!

There were dishes that we liked - the salmon sashimi was excellent, the corn tempura precisely what it should be. The black cod was very fine but grossly overpriced for the incredibly skimpy size. The pork belly skewer was tasty, if rich (2/3 fat to 1/3 lean).

But the octopus dishes, both cooked and raw were simply unpleasant. The eggplant was an oily mess. The duck w/tare and sirloin yakitori were blandly generic, while the tongue showed the weaknesses of Japanese cuisine in seasoning and technique. The simmered (braised) pork was good, but a modest competitor 15 min away does the same dish better and cheaper.

The roasted tea blanc-manger was pleasing, but not remarkable enough to be destination-worthy. Also, texture was more like agar-agar than cornstarch (this is a dessert essentially unchanged from Medieval Europe days).

Although we tried 13 dishes, we didn't find enough to be worth a return, nor to justify ever standing in line - which we didn't. If you make a reservation with a $40/pp minimum - easy to do here, with tiny portions and high prices - you can simply walk in past the crowd.",2.0

A5 Wagyu nigiri, damn good, thin slice, but well marbled.
Beef tongue skewer, meaty with some bits of fat, I like this texture.
5 type sashimi, fresh, good, could order again.

Maybe order again:
Corn tempura, 2 pieces, I remember this being more crunchy and awesome. Still good now. Something different.
Yuba, not bad, but not sure if the tofu skin helps the roe and uni flavors at all.
Canadian pork kakuni, soft tender pieces, fat well rendered, egg not too tasty.
Premium angus beef tongue, bigger plate than I imagined, truffle oil and salt brings out flavors, tender.
Beef intestine skewer, very meltttty fatty piece outside and intestine is chewy, super well charred, very fragrant fat smell.",5.0
2019,"This place is well deserving of its 4.5 stars aggregated rating and all the glowing reviews! Do prepare to drop some major dough $$ though. For the two of us, we spent close to $100 for 1 sparkling sake + a bunch of izakaya dishes. I think we did over-order by one dish though as we were super stuffed.

My mom and I came 10 minutes before opening and there was hardly a wait. Even after 30 minutes past opening time, there were still a handful of tables left. Maybe we came on a good day? If you can, try to avoid sitting right by the door as you would get the stench of urine from the wind blowing in smells through the open door.

We wound up getting the:

Suzuki (5/5): Super amazing. Would definitely order again. The sauce was perfection.

Pork Belly Skewer (4/5): Right ratio of fat and meat. A bit salty though. Depending on how I feel, I might skip this

Beef Tongue w/ truffle oil and Sea Salt (5/5): Very tender and the perfect amount of done. Perfectly seasoned. You can definitely taste and smell the truffle oil.

Scallop Skewer (3/5): I am meh on the dish, but my mom really enjoyed it. There wasn't much flavor imo and the scallops were a bit tough.

Yuba Spoons (4/5): Only complaint is that I wish they gave me more uni as the eggs overwhelmed any other taste

Eggplant (3/5): Nothing special about it. The sauce was a bit too sweet for me.

Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!",5.0
2019,"They don't take reservations but you can sign up on their wait list from Yelp.  Expect a very long wait. On a weekend on opening time at 5:30PM, when we checked it gave us an estimate of 7:45PM. Street parking can be challenging but doable if you're willing to walk a few blocks.

But if you can put up with the wait, you're in for a treat. The restaurant is not that big, can can only seat about 35 to 40 people (one restroom stall). Without a doubt, the food here is fresh. Their fish collar is not what you expect.. it is HUGE and can easily be shared between 6 to 10 people. Grill Octopus was excellent. The Wagyu Carpaccio was strange as we had two orders but both order the Wagyu have different colors and texture. Excellent varieties of Saki.

Service was a bit unique as this is one of the place I can recall that impose a per person service charge for cutting a birthday cake. Also there's a small surcharge for credit card usage.",5.0
2019,"Everything here is really good, but I didn't really find anything that blew my mind away. None the less, you should try this restaurant for the uniqueness of the items on their menu. There aren't a lot of other places in the Bay that serves what they have.

This is a really small restaurant. ""Rubbing shoulders with your neighbor"" is a literal saying here.

If you're going to use Yelp waitlist to get a table, you need to tell them when you arrive or else they will assume you're not there. They don't bother calling your name until you check in here. This is how I got my table given away to the party after me :( Other than this, service was friendly and attentive.

This is what my party of 2 ate:

- Corn tempura: Tastes like what it sounds like
- Spicy jellyfish: Love this! Really fresh and flavorful.
- Beef tongue skewer: This was the most disappointing item. Some pieces of it were over done, so the beef had a tough/stringy texture
- Clam & cilantro ramen: Clear-ish broth soup and it wasn't really heavy. Loved this!!
- chicken cartilage: Taste and texture is what you'd expect. The batter was really light and this was perfectly fried too
- black cod: really good, but didn't taste too different than when I had this dish elsewhere
- Kyoto beer: I already want another one
- Aged plum wine: delish & refreshing

Arrived right when it opened at 5:30p and there was already a line to get in.  The dining area was intimate and became packed about 30-45 min into our dinner.

My coworkers and I ordered a variety of food and  each dish was executed so well.

- tempura corn fritters- whimsical with a nice crunch and sweet corn flavor
-garlic edamame- savory and fresh
- beef tongue skewers - super tender and tasty
- pork belly skewers- delicious with the miso paste
- albacore ceviche -  bright and refreshing
- clam and cilantro ramen- flavorful depth of broth
- agedashi cod- umami notes
- salmon roe fried rice - salty goodness
- rice balls with shiso leaf - perfect to accompany the proteins
- blue fin tuna kama (OMG this was my favorite dish. Huge collar bone with the most tender flaky meat.  Takes 30 min to make so order right away.  $40 and so worth it, especially with a big group.
- Sochu samplers - I liked the Tekkan (distilled from sweet potato and rice) and Kanokko (distilled from barley and similar to whiskey)

Beef tongue - cooked to right temperature.",5.0
2019,"This is the first time I had Japanese food in the US. Kiraku is at a good price, convenient place, the services are nice as well. I like their food very much, especially for the beef tongue.
But then, I do think it's necessary for the staff to higher their voice as it's quick noisy there and I could barely hear what they say when I get my menu. Hence, I do think it's a little bit difficult for us to read the menu without a photo as many of the names are named with Japanese English that we are not easy to understand. This greatly slower our ordering speed.
Overall, I do think this is a good restaurant and I recommend you all to try.",4.0

We ordered:

- chefs choice of three: tuna, salmon and scallop. Definitely would order this again!! So fresh and good. 5/5

- beef tataki: thinly sliced pieces, aesthetically pleasing but I've definitely had better. 4/5

- corn tempura: wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did but wow!! Yum!! 5/5

- kaison don: the bowl is definitely a lot smaller than I thought, maybe 3x3"" in diameter and half of it was rice. Though the contents were great, I did expect more. 4.5/5

- Canadian pork belly with runny egg: MUST ORDER THIS. This was my favorite thing. 5/5

- sweet potato fries: we had to ask for a tempura sauce because it just felt like it was missing something. 3.5/5

- yaki udon comes with octopus and basil sauce: compared to the other orders, this bowl seemed ginormous. But if you compared this bowl size to any other restaurant, then it would be a regular sized bowl.

I'll be coming here on rainy nights only from now on just to avoid a wait.

- Yuba: These are magical spoonfuls of uni and ikura. The taste of ocean but not too much ocean just explodes as soon as you put it in your mouth :')

- Corn Tempura: I can't even describe how good these are. I could order 5 of these and be happy.

- Shime Saba: Torched pieces of makerel sashi, super decadent and the torched part gives it the perfect amount of smoky flavor.

- Black Cod: Butterygoodness

*** Mehs***
- Grilled Beef Tongue: I would recommend getting either the skewer or the truffle beef tongue over this. It's less flavorful than the other two and a little more chewy imo.

- Snow crab Broccolini with Uni: I was excited for this one, but I thought it was a little too bitter. There's also very little snow crab.

I would prefer enjoying each separately.",2.0
2019,"One of my favorite spots of all-time in Berkeley. When I think great food scene to introduce to an out-of-town friend, Kiraku is one of few restaurants immediately on the tip of my tongue.

Reason being? Everything I've ordered at Kiraku has been a success. I have yet to be disappointed by Kiraku's menu. Granted, I've only been there for a total of 4-5 times, but I have oftentimes tried to veer away from repeating favorites too often and try new things. The fact that Kiraku is a tapas restaurant, which invites people to share and talk over that complementary hot sake and bit of sashimi, makes eating there a wonderful dining experience from beginning to end.

The wait is worth it if you're a fan of Japanese food. I also like Ippuku on Center St. but Kiraku is hard to beat, thanks to its fantastic menu and cheery, loud ambiance.",5.0
2019,"Don't get me wrong.  The food is good, consistently.  Always, people are waiting to get in when they open at 5:30pm.  What surprised me this time, though, is to find the extra charge the owners decided to put on when customers pay with credit cards.  In this age of digital payment, the management is penalizing the use of credit/debit card, and their reasoning is ""to be fair to cash paying customers"".    ( Please see the notice on the restroom door.  )In my opinion, they are actually promoting/encouraging cash payment, instead.   Maybe the local State Board of Equalization should come pay a visit?  
Average bill for two of us usually runs about $80~$100, here.  This is not a mom and pop shop where they cannot afford credit/debit card transaction fee.  And this store is always packed.  
Maybe I am a little harsh but this doesn't sound right, in my opinion.  The penalty to use credit card turns out to be approx 5% of the bill.(Please see the 2nd photo) The owners claim that this extra 5% is the convenience fee that is being charged by processing companies, which I very much doubt, since the charge amounts are fairly large, at this store, and it shouldn't be that high, in my opinion.  In any case, with this logic, other fine restaurants that are packed with customers every night should follow the suit, as wells as fine hotels?
Okay, well, I will consider this 5% as a extra tip to the owner!  Cheers.",1.0
2019,"Kiraku is a small izakaya serving Japanese dishes. I really liked this spot and will definitely return.

We tried a bunch of items but the standouts were the grilled shio saba ( grilled salted mackerel) and the beef tongue with truffle oil and salt.

I loved how friendly the service was and how you get to choose your own cup ( I think the owner might be a pottery enthusiast? ) I choose a slightly squat, round sake cup, and it gave me joy every time I drank from it.

2019,"I wanted to take my best friend out for his birthday. After searching yelp I narrowed down to this place. I had a hard time finding how to make reservations so I decided to call, I called boom reservations.

People mistake the yelp waitlist booking for reservations, don't be those people. Call if you want reservations. Don't show up earlier thinking you will get priority since you have reservations. Come at the time of your reservations.

So we ubered it there from Oakland and guess what? We got here early. We had to wait until our exact reservations time then we sat down. Lesson learned.

The place is quite small, it better be worth the wait.Started with some sake I forget which.

First thing was uni spoons. Yummy.

Suzuki carpaccio was up next. That s**t was smokey and finger licking good.

The corn tempura was cooked to perfection, it had a nice crunch and it was lite. Probably one my favorite dishes.

Okay so far so good next, the beef tongue skewers didn't look to good when it came out but boy I was wrong. Very tender tongue.

Beef intestine skewers had a nice char taste to it. But it did seem like I was eating fat.

Last was the roast duck. Me and buddy didn't like it. I guess we don't like the idea how it wasn't fully cooked. But I can see why others like it.

All in all, if you do the reservations right, it's a pretty cool joint. Food is good. Place is quite small. Would I go back again? Probably a one time thing for me at least but worth to check out.",4.0
2019,"Wow! The food here was incredible. Came here with two friends and I don't think there was a single dish I didn't like. The place is small so expect a wait -- we had to wait almost an hour and a half, but Kiraku uses Yelp to manage their waitlist so you can sign up for the wait without even being at the restaurant! The service will let you know how many people are ahead of you and when you should aim to be there.

All the plates are pretty small so you should order a lot and expect to pay a bit more than you might for your average meal. That said, for the quality of the food, the price is really not bad.

Some of my favorite dishes:
- Corn tempura
- Croquette
- Tuna cheek
- Pork belly with soft boiled egg

Everything was delicious but the sea bass, I should've just went for the salmon but I wanted to try something new. Get the fried corn, croquet, tuna cheek, waygu, and clam ramen! You won't be disappointed with those dishes. It's cheaper if you bring cash. There is a surcharge for credit and they're upfront about it on the menu by indicating cash prices. I think if you make reservations it's a $40 minimum per person.

2019,"TL;DR: great small menu items to share, long wait times, great for dates and special occasions!

I've been meaning to try Kiraku out for my entire time in Berkeley! Although I'm glad I finally tried it, I wasn't exactly sure what I expected. This small restaurant, despite its daily wait time and tight seating area, is a great location for special occasions and dates. It can be too pricey for your average college student, but I would like to come back in the future for a special reason.

I went with my family for my sister's birthday and we ordered a wide variety of items. The list is: Baby Squid, Baby Scallop Skewer, Pork Belly Skewer, S&P Soft Shell Crab, Agedashi Tofu, Chicken Karage, Corn Tempura, Roasted Duck, Wagyu Beef Nigiri w/ Uni, and Yaki Udon. Since there are so many items, I'm ditching my usual review form and just talking about highlights.

PROS: My favorite dishes of the night were the pork belly, roasted duck, agedashi tofu, and corn tempura (in that order). The pork belly was exactly what I was looking for in terms of a tapa and savory dish. The added paste was a great add on and added a lot to the flavor. The roasted duck was a pretty large dish, so it was great to share. Not too gamey and really good quality meat. Agedashi tofu was a strong serving with a delicious sauce, also great to share. The corn tempura, as many others have said, is exactly what you would expect. However, I loved the sweetness of the corn and I thought it paired well with the sauce from the tofu.

DELTAS: To start, I didn't really enjoy the baby squid because raw squid is not really my thing. It was really salty and slimy with an undertone of soy sauce, so I wouldn't have it again. Contrary to popular opinions, I thought the wagyu beef nigiri was underwhelming. I feel that the uni and wasabi strongly overpowered the dish, which made it still enjoyable, but I was hoping for more beef flavor. To end our meal, we shared the yaki udon, which had to be the most interesting dish of the night. I enjoyed the umami of the bonito flakes, but pesto with udon wasn't a mix for me.

The wait time was pretty abysmal, even for a Thursday night and using the waitlist. There's almost no room to wait around, so most parties have to wait outside. Utilize the Yelp waitlist as early as you can. I think this is a really great location for a date or celebration with smaller parties. This is no way an every week meal, as it's super pricey considering the restaurants around it. However, it has a great reputation in Southside for a reason. I'm excited to come back to this location in the future with a special someone or when I have a better palette for high-end foods.",4.0
2019,"An unforgettable meal of Japanese tapas. Will cost you a pretty penny for maximum enjoyment.

Wagyu beef - delicate and tasty
Roasted duck - perfectly crispy and sweet duck skin with a hearty bite of meat
Salmon sashimi - generously buttery and hefty  
Buta kim - decent, but forgettable. Junk food style dish with overly sauced vegetables and excessively fatty meat
Beef tongue - bold, smoky, barbecue-ish flavor that I could lick clean
Corn tempura - I would not get this normally, but the meal lacks carbs, and this surprisingly tasty dish ties everything together

Cost about $85 for 6 dishes. Don't have a reason to be in Berkeley, but this restaurant gives me 6.",5.0
2019,"Must make reservations. My friend and I thought we would join the waitlist right at 5:30 when it opened on yelp. We did that and was told to check in at 6:30, which we did. But then we still didn't get seated until 8. We wouldn't mind just getting there at 8 but the yelp waitlist estimate was incredibly wrong.

Group of 4 saw the menu and didn't like the food but we had ordered 2 items the fish head and seaweed salad . We wanted to leave but they said we are required to order at least 15$ each . Shock number 2 , we used our credit card to pay and was charged $3 for using a credit card instead of cash ... never going back to this place . We were hustled out of our money .

2018,"Ok ok not bad of a place... Met with a few friends for an easy Izakaya place to spend well over $100 on delicious and fresh Japanese food why not here. The quality of the food is excellent, and the unique seasonal items make the place special.
The decor has that OG Japanese feel, portions are small but thats true Izakaya style bar.
My recommendations the grilled squid, the fois gras seasonal item, karage chicken, the one spooner uni, there sashimi, beef tongue, and check out the rest of my pics DELICIOUS! When i go back to the bay im back for sure!",4.0
2019,"They have items on the menu that I haven't seen anywhere else. Not to mention that everything I've tried here is amazing. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation first to skip the wait. Reservations require a $40 spend per person, but it's well worth it. They never rush you and all of the staff are amazing!

This stop we ordered:
The tsunami sampler with fermented firefly baby squid, smoked pickles with cream cheese, and spicy jellyfish. All were great, and for $11 the portions were small but adequate for snacking. The only small disappointment was the jellyfish, with no hint of spice (though it was still tasty)
Black pork belly skewer, yum!
Baby scallop skewer, great bbq flavor with the organs intact. They were damn tasty!
Sliced mackerel, tasty, clean and fatty. Great taste and a decent portion.
Black cod grilled with sake lees, a definite go to!
7 fish two piece each sashimi platter. $44 and every piece of fish is premium and delicious in its own right!
Tempura corn with green tea salt, yes it sounds simple and it is, but it goes great with beer and a good little snack :)
Their beers are solid too, give them a try. You may leave with your picket a little lighter, but I promise you that the food will be amazing!!!",5.0
2018,"Came here for a more ""fine dining"" experience, and I now wish I knew about this place earlier - especially since it's pretty close to campus!

My boyfriend and I arrived at around 5:45 PM on a Tuesday night and it was already getting full inside the restaurant. We were able to nab a seat, and we ordered a total of 6 dishes.

Yuba - 4.5/5
A spoonful of salmon eggs and a slice of sea urchin. It tasted like the ocean in the best and most pure way possible. Extremely fresh and amazingly soft of texture. Perfect start to our meal.

Suzuki Carpaccio - 4.5/5
I don't think I've ever tasted anything quite like this before. It was delicate and flavorful at the same time, can't really describe it more!

Beef Tongue Skewer - 5/5
Favorite dish of the night. Extremely tender meat topped with a delicious sauce.

Jumbo Squid - 3/5
Not bad but lackluster when compared to the other dishes. Squid did not have a lot of flavor on its own, so the dipping sauce on the side is a must. Very chewy and filled us up.  

Karaage - 4.5/5
Yum! It's like the popcorn chicken you can get at boba shops but much tastier. Unexpectedly juicy, and just the right amount of crisp on the outside.

Corn Tempura - 4/5
Great dish to finish off our meal. Tasted like how you would expect deep fried corn to taste like. A bit sweet which I enjoyed.

I will definitely be coming back on a special occasion to give their other dishes a try. 6 dishes was the right amount for 2 people without feeling overly indulgent. Hands down one of the best restaurants in Berkeley.",5.0
2018,"I've heard about Kiraku from my friend, specifically because she knew my love for corn and had highly recommended the corn tempura.

Kiraku is a very intimate restaurant with limited seating, so make sure to go early if you want to get into the first round of seating! When my sister and I arrived around 5:40pm shortly after they opened, there was already a pretty long waitlist since we missed the first seating. We waited for about an hour and was seated around 6:30-6:45PM.

We ordered the Suzuki Carpaccio, the corn tempura (a must for me!), the grilled onigiri, Moro Q, jumbo grilled squid, and grilled beef tongue for two people. We were actually able to finish all the dishes as they are all fairly small plates.

I would recommend all the dishes we ordered except for maybe the grilled onigiri. While it was decent, I thought it was a bit plain and the flavor was too similar to the Moro Q that it felt extra for our meal. My favorite dishes from the meal was the corn tempura, jumbo squid, and beef tongue!",5.0
2019,"Wow this place definitely lives up to the hype. Definitely waitlist on Yelp beforehand otherwise you're looking at an hour wait at least. In order from best to ""worst"":

1. Suzuki carpaccio - so flavorful, just the right tang of yuzu and seasoning with very fresh fish.

2. Wagyu beef tataki - the beef is not chewy at all and super tender. Be sure to get a bit of garlic and green onion in every bite.

3. Corn tempura - sweet and salty and crispy, fried yet light. Just the right bite between all the meat.

4. Beef tongue skewers - be sure to get this and not the roast tongue. The sauce cuts through the richness of the meat and it just melts in your mouth.

5. Roast duck - As a huge fan of Peking duck, I feel that other preparations just dont bring out as much of the flavor. But this was still very good, tender and well cooked.

6. Roasted tea blanc manger - Good green tea flavor topped with red bean and cream. Creamy but very light and a great way to end the meal.  

7. Chicken cartilage - yummy little crunchy pieces of goodness. Very flavorful and goes well with sake.

8. Yuzu spoons - too much salmon roe compared to uni, and $6 per spoon is quite expensive. But the quality of ingredients were fantastic.

9. Grilled rice ball - a bit too salty but a lot of miso flavor and perfectly grilled.

We also got a sake sampler which was very worth. The subtotal came out to 103 for the 2 of us and we left decently full. Definitely going to come back when I get the chance!",5.0

The food was BOMB.  I enjoyed everything I had!!!  Here are some of my  favorites:

Corn Tempura:  This is one you want to eat right away.  It smells like fresh popcorn.  The texture is light and crunchy.  The flavors was slightly sweet with a hint of saltiness.  

5 Types Chef Selection Sashimi:  I don't think I can remember having fresher fish.  My favorites were Black Snapper and Toro from Spain.  I could if had the plate to myself.

Waygu Beef with Uni:   The Uni is from Haikaido, which I'm told is known for its seafood.  This was super delicious. It's a flavor that I haven't had together ever.  Very good!

Hot Tea:   I know, I know it's just tea.  But honestly the tea  in this place is crazy good. I would take a bite of my food and wash it down with the tea...and then magic.  The tea here compliments the dishes here and cleanses the palate.  I know it is roasted green tea, but it had sort of a jasmine/floral finish. I couldn't stop drinking it.

The staff and service were top notch.  The food came out with good timing.  And the people here are friendly and very helpful.  I will be back!!!",4.0

Their food is pretty good, but no dish really stood out to me. We ordered a scallops skewer, beef intestine skewer, pork belly skewer, takowasabi, corn tempura, wrapped salmon (salmon and mushroom wrapped in foil, roasted premium angus beef tongue, yuzu chicken udon, mini kaisen donburi, yuba, snow crab and avocado dip, sashimi special, suzuki carpaccio, and a pitcher of asahi beer.

This is not your typical Japanese restaurant with sushi, teriyaki, and bento boxes. Kiraku specializes in tapas-like dishes and some traditional Japanese dishes that you don't see at a lot of Korean-owned Japanese restaurants.

What to order~ omelette salad, chazuke, chicken karaage

What we ordered~

Omelette Salad ($8): never seen this before! It was so yummy-there was pork belly, egg, and shredded cabbage stuffed inside the omelette. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It's a bit messy to share, though.

Buta Kim ($10): sauteed kimchi, pork belly, and egg. I'm seeing a trend of pork belly here, and it sure is delicious! The pork belly melts in your mouth.

Deluxe Chazuke ($10): I'm half Japanese and have dined at many a Japanese restaurant yet have never seen this dish before! Where has it been all my life? It's so healthy, and soothing on a cold day! Chazuke is made by pouring hot water/tea over rice and it is topped with salmon, plum, takana, and mentaiko. This one comes with the toppings laid out on a dish, and with the broth in a teapot, so you get to assemble it yourself which is pretty fun! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!

Also tried fried cartilage ($8)-was not a fan of that. The crunch was too akin to the sound of cracking and it felt like I was eating a bone. But hey, I know the Japanese like to utilize every part of the animal to minimize waste.

DO GET the chicken karaage ($9). I've tried it at a few places, but this one is hands down the BEST! It's perfectly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside! Don't forget to dip it in the spicy mayo.

Tender Beef Tongue Skewer ($5): Don't be deterred by the name. It still tastes like meat and is quite good!

Service was friendly, attentive, and quick! We ordered multiple rounds of food and did not have to wait too long after placing our orders to receive the food.

To be fair, they asked if there was any problem but since my friend was the one who paid it, I don't know how much she gave and what happened. I told her that I don't know anything and then she told me maybe next time I should give accordingly.

2018,"This is my sixth or seventh time going to Kiraku, and it never ceases to amaze me how delicious and heartwarming their food is. I went at 5:30PM on a Thursday evening, but expect a wait if you arrive after 7PM on any of the days. Reservations can be made by calling them beforehand. The restaurant itself a nice and cozy Japanese joint, with traditional decorations and glassware around the interior. You're greeted by a warm staff that is representative of the family-run establishment that Kiraku is, as well as warm hand towels to clean your hands. The menu is extensive, containing traditional Izakaya items and also seasonal specials that they have. If you're a first timer, or a regular, the fun of coming to Kiraku is looking at the menu and choosing through all of the delicious-sounding food on their menu. Now, onto the MUST GETS at Kiraku:

Salmon Carpaccio/Sashimi - Fresh, perfectly sliced salmon with a citrus sauce, red onion, and some greens on top. Flavors worked extremely well and if you're a big fan of Salmon sashimi, I would recommend either the carpaccio or Sashimi due to the high quality of the fish.

Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - Probably the best corn anything I've ever had. The batter that they use for the tempura is so light but also provides enough of a crunch where you get a great bite from the sweet fried corn. The green tea salt on top provides the perfect hint of saltiness as well.

Beef Tongue Skewers - One of the most underrated and unknown dishes here. You HAVE to try it. If the idea of beef tongue is off-putting to you, trying this will change your opinion completely. The beef tongue is a bit thicker than what you would normally get at a Korean barbecue place, but they grill it so tender and succulent, and top it off with a sweet and savory sauce.

Canadian Black Pork Kakuni - The most tender pork belly I've ever had. The fat LITERALLY melts in your mouth. They give you 4 generous pieces, including a luxurious egg that contains the perfect gooey center. In addition, the meat is cooked in a sweet and salty dark broth that coats every inch the pork.

Black Miso Cod - The cod is extremely tender and marinated and cooked to perfection. The fish is super soft and flaky and provides such a great mouthful when you eat it. The sauce and marinade that the fish comes with are sweet and savory, and even the skin of the fish provides you with a little fatty treat.

Oyako-don: A traditional Japanese dish consisting of cooked chicken and onions with eggs on top of a bed of rice, Kiraku truly does the dish justice. The chicken and eggs are perfectly cooked, while the onions provide enough of a bite. The sauce that the fish is cooked in is slightly sweet and very savory, making the combination of the rice bowl really special.

Honorary Mention: Roasted Premium Angus Beef Tongue - This fish is one of those dishes you have to try at least once here. It comes at a hefty price of $18, but the beef tongue is perfectly cooked and the seasoning on the meat is amazing. The meat is cut into medium thin slices and served with some side condiments.",5.0
2018,"Kiraku is delicious, but on the pricier end, especially if you're a student. My favorite dish was the suzuki carpaccio. The yuzu citrus was very potent, so it can be a bit sour for some people, but I loved it.

I tried the hyped corn tempura with green tea salt, which was really good, but I couldn't really taste the green tea in the salt.

The butcher's croquette is super creamy and filling, and it was a good item to try! I was a bit disappointed with the agedashi tofu, since the breading tasted a bit mushy. The broth was good though!

I enjoyed the takowasabi in my first few tastings, but it was waaay too salty for me. It had a good flavor, and I love wasabi.

Snow crab and broccolini was good, but there wasn't a lot of snow crab. Sad. It was basically all brocoolini...",4.0
2018,"Kiraku was my first foray into Japanese-style tapas, and boy, was I missing out. Every dish we ordered was pure divine with the wagyu beef tataki and salmon carpaccio being standouts for the night. This place is definitely pricey, but we were celebrating something so it was okay. Not an everyday place though!

On a Wednesday night, we arrived around 7pm and had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table for 2. This restaurant is quite small, but there was a line all night long.. the food is that good. Our server was super friendly and helpful with recommendations. Here's what we tried:

-salmon carpaccio- favorite dish of the night! There was something magical about the fresh fish with the acidic tomatoes and the fried garlic. MUST TRY!

-wagyu beef tataki- I could eat several plates of this by myself. This was my first time trying wagyu and I get the hype! SOOO GOOD!

-baby scallops skewer- I'm very picky about seafood and although this had the slightest fishy taste, it was overall pretty good.

-chicken karage- juicy, dark meat with a mustardy mayo sauce. One of our more substantial plates that help you fill up when you're having thinly sliced meats and fish for the rest of your meal.

-corn fritters- these are fun. The corn tastes super sweet! I wish it came with a dipping sauce.

-pork belly skewers- these were alright. Not as tender as I expect pork belly to be, but the dipping sauce was really good.

-roasted duck breast- THIS WAS ALSO AMAZING! I'm usually not a duck fan, but apparently roasted duck is totally my thing. You can't go wrong with this one.

-wagyu beef nigiri with uni- it was my first time trying uni as well. This was a nice little bite, but idk if it's worth the price. Because it was in nigiri form, the whole thing went down quick and I didn't taste much of the uni. I guess there was a slight metallic, briny taste in my mouth, but that was all. I did taste a LOT of wasabi though.

-roasted tea blanc manger- we took Yelp's advice and ordered this and we were so, so glad. This is a delicate, light, not too sweet dessert. The base is a roasted tea custard that I very much enjoyed. The custard is topped with a dollop of a super light whipped cream and another dollop of what tasted like bean paste and some tiny tapioca balls. What a perfect end to an exceptional dinner.

Sake- we are not huge into sake but decided to give it a try since kiraku has a full menu just for sake! We settled on the kiraku sampler (one dry, one medium, and one sweet sake). The dry one went great with food, but the medium and sweet were a little too sweet for us.

The menu is pretty extensive, so I can't wait to come back for another celebration!",5.0
2019,"This was pretty good, but I don't know if it was really worth the 1 hour wait. Expectations at this price point and waiting time are both good food and good servcie. The service is really good, no comments there.

The food: The sashimi combo was great, I wasn't a huge fan of the albacore tataki. The fried rice ball was just okay. Also got the sirloin skewer, which was pretty good. What surprised me about the skewer was that it was actually pretty cooked (not like a rare skewer or anything) but it's still flavorful. This is some of the best wasabi you'll find in the Berkeley area, and I suspect most places nearby are giving horseradish instead.

The environment: The inside of the restaurant is nice. It would probably make a good date spot, also seems like it'd be fun with a big group of people.

2018,"Funny story about this location. So, this location and the building next to it used to be one restaurant, my mom's restaurant that she ran in the 90's called Special Kitchen serving up Korean BBQ before it was big like it is now. Dining here really brought back some nostalgic memories I had here and the neighborhood!

My partner and I dined here to celebrate our anniversary and we arrived right when they opened to a packed house with 2 seat available in such an awkward location on the seating floor. We were seated dead center of the room surrounded by diners and the older lady who was sitting to my right was flipping her hair and almost hitting me with it every time. I don't know how our servers maneuver to get to us but they did it flawlessly and with their delicious tapas style dishes you don't feel so congested anymore and all the distracting conversations in the background seems to go away. Power of food...

The food:

We ordered the snow crab & broccolini, suzuki carpaccio, wagyu beef tataki, American wagyu beef nigiri with uni from Hokkaido, beef intestine skewer, black pork belly skewer, omelet salad, and the roasted duck.

The Snow Crab & Broccolini was made with real crab mixed with broccolini and all sorts of light and delicate flavors from tart, sweet, sour, and spice, a real umami dish.

the suzuki carpaccio and wagyu beef tataki was executed extremely well. All the flavors were on point and complemented the dishes of rich yet, light flavors. I have had a better beef tataki in the city (Tokyo go-go) before but, that place shut down and this is a real close replacement of my favorite tataki.

The beef intestine was really chewy and fatty. The intestine tasted really clean and dressed in a light soy sauce and green onions the flavors were excellent. But, a little too fatty for me. The Black pork belly skewer however was just perfect in all kinds of ways.

The Omelet salad was by far our favorite dish. It comes out large and you'd think it'll fill you up but, this omelet is light and extremely satisfying. It's basically a light variation of an Okonomiyaki with a thin layer of egg that wraps around a bed of thin sliced cabbage topped off with the popular okonomiyaki sauce and thin dried fish that dances at you before you dig in. This is a must get when you dine here to start off your tapas adventure.

The American beef wagyu nigiri with uni was an experience.  I'd say it's one of those dishes where you either hate it or like it. I liked the complexity of the dish from going with full on uni flavor and as you chew the nigiri up the flavors of the American wagyu comes out blending into the sea urchins fragrance. It's really a different experience from tasting the sea to the smokey beef flavor. The buttery uni to light chew of the beef. It's a total mind and taste bud experience that's uniquely contradicting but, works for me. It didn't work so well with my partner though.

The roasted duck was probably our least favorite dish. The duck was cooked perfectly and the garnish really heightened the flavor of the meat but, the sauce they drenched over the whole slices of duck over powered all of what would of made this dish amazing.

The beers and sake cocktails are a must have!

End food review

Yes, the place is pricey but, for the quality of ingredients the full umami experience you don't really get from a lot of Japanese restaurants i say it's worth the price. This is a tapas place so, yeah, the portions are on the smaller side so, don't come here if you're starving you'll blow through so much money dining here. I say Kiraku is more of a food experience. You don't come here starving like any normal restaurant you come here to order what you would think would be appetizing and give your taste buds a little flavor experience because it's really about how the chefs play with different seasonings to heighten the flavors of their dishes.

Come super early (before the restaurant opens) to get prime seating options. By the time we got done with our courses there was a large amount of people waiting to dine here. The staff were all amazing, checking up on us, checking on our orders, clearing plates as we finish every dish, and they were all extremely friendly.",4.0
2019,"This was our first time at Kiraku and we weren't disappointed! We used the waitlist feature on Yelp in order to save us a place on a busy Thursday and once we got there, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our table (not bad for a small place that can seat max 40 people).
The other two people I was with aren't super adventurous eaters, but we still managed to find things on their menu that everyone was happy to eat! We started with their simmered beef and scallion pancake and the suzuki carpaccio. The pancake had amazing flavor and was super fluffy. The beef in it was melt in your mouth soft and there were such large flavorful chunks of scallion - this is a good item for everyone! The striped bass carpaccio was one of my favorite things that I ate, even the member of our group who disliked fish enjoyed it! The bass was clean and fresh, the house made sesame oil drizzled over it was so rich and a perfect complement to the fish, and the ginger citrus topping just rounded out the whole bite!
We followed those items up with one pork belly skewer, a beef sirloin skewer, and the american wagyu beef nigiri with uni. The skewers were good, flavor was alright for the price - but definitely not our favorite things we had there, doesn't mean it wasn't delicious! The beef nigiri though was a real highlight. First off, it was beautifully presented, and who thought the combo of beef and uni would work - but it was a glorious mix of land and sea in one perfect bite (complete with a nice kick from the wasabi underneath).
We finished off the evening with a bowl of oyako-don. This was surprisingly one of my favorite things I ate. The whole dish was perfectly melded together. The mushrooms, onions, and simmered chicken created the perfect rich sauce to soak into the rice - and egg is always a good edition.
The staff here was also super helpful, they gave us great recommendations and overall we felt very well taken care of. So thank you Kiraku for a wonderful ladies night!",5.0
2018,"Excellent Japanese Tapas restaurant, pricey but top notch quality food. Bill $207 for 12 small plates is no issue compares to how wonderful they all taste.

The service was excellent and we loved all the dishes we tried. A few favorites would be the corn tempura, yuba, and the sashimi platter. The corn tempura was definitely unique, but so addicting! It was perfectly seasoned and crispy. I love anything with fish eggs and uni so the yuba was an instant love. I also may be a little late, but oh WOW. Toro is freakin bomb! All the sashimi tasted fresh, but the toro melted in your mouth. No wonder it's expensive on its own lol!

2019,"Incredibly disappointed with the service here.

I went with my friends hoping for a fun night with good food, but we all left with a relatively empty stomach and shitty mood.

1. Our group of five was sat at a table that was clearly for a group of four. In fact, we were only given four of each item at the table and had to ask the waitress for another of each item, and even then we weren't given a fifth menu. (Note: We were on the waitlist through Yelp so they definitely knew we were a group of five and not four.)

2. The attitude of the servers were awful. They were visibly irritated when we were ordering food and was pressuring us to order faster even though we had our orders ready and articulated our orders well (both pointing to the order on the menu and saying it verbally).

3. The portion for each dish was small and expensive but the quality of the food was not even that spectacular--definitely not worth the price.

4. We weren't enjoying the service because they never checked up on us and they didn't even refill our water until after we asked 3 times.

Lastly, we had to ask them for the check 3 times (I see a trend...) until they finally gave it to us after 40 minutes of us waiting. The worst part was they they were not even busy. The waitresses were literally standing around having conversations with each other.

Japanese restaurant service is supposed to be excelling or at the very least normal, so disappointed emerged from our group as we received mediocre service at a restaurant that boasted, ""genuine Japanese experience"".

Because of the horrendous service, we tipped low and left quickly. We thought the nightmare was over but then one of the waitresses chased us down the sidewalk to frustratingly ask us why we tipped low. We started asserting exactly why, but before we even finished talking, she interrupted us and said, ""maybe you should not come here anymore"".
She's right. In fact, maybe no one should.",1.0

2019,"This was my favorite Izakaya for years, but I will probably not be coming back anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, the food is great for Bay Area yakitori standards, but the dining experience is no longer enjoyable for me for the price.

The restaurant is very small, only about 40 seats or so. Given the quality of the food, it's no surprise that there's always a crowd. Izakayas are meant to be intimate settings where one can order a bunch of little dishes and a good bottle of sake, and enjoy the food and the drink with a good friend on a relaxing night. That is no longer the case at Kiraku. The restaurant is hell bent on flipping the tables as many times as possible that once all of your dishes have been served, you begin to feel the pressure of the staff trying to whisk you out the door. We were given our check even though we still had over half a bottle of sake left. We were then forced to down the rest of our alcohol when one of the waitstaff approached and asked us whether we were done because there are others waiting to be seated.

Another new policy that I find disturbing is the 4% fee they've passed on to credit card payments in order ""to be fair to the cash-paying customers"", which sounds like complete bull to me. To add insult to injury, they do not tell you of this charge beforehand, it is in a message taped to the check booklet and you will not see it until you request for the check. A meal plus drinks can easily run into the 3-digit zone, and I for one do not usually carry hundreds of dollars of cash on my person. Mind you, there is also a minimum per person charge of $40, which they do post outside the door.

All in all, there's just way too many rules and restrictions for some yakitori. I have been delighted at the many Izakayas that have popped up in the area in recent years and am now more than ever motivated to check them out. Kiraku may still be one of the best ones around in terms of food, but it is no longer my only choice.",3.0
2019,"Small restaurant and great food. Very good atmosphere, fast service, except a long waiting list. Make sure you get your name on it on Yelp hours before you go, or you spend a lot of time waiting. One of us couldn't eat seafood that day so we went all non-seafood, kind of tricky in a Japanese restaurant. We ordered:
- corn tempura: this is hard to do right, but they did it well and it seems like a semi-signature dish here?
- beef tongue skewer: as expected
- pork belly skewer: a bit dry, I would expect a bit more fat on it
- chicken karaage: not the juiciest but ok
- yaki udon: with pesto, I really like this one!

2019,"This place is going to be my new favorite spot! My three friends and I could not decide on what to order, so we each got 2-3 plates each. My favorite was the mini donburi that had crab salad, salmon, seaweed salad and uni. IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!

The sake menu was pretty extensive as well. It was soooo cute! Our server had us pick our own little sake cup. The carafe for the sake kind of looked like a wine decanter with a side pocket for ice. It's to keep your sake cold without it melting and watering down your sake. GENIUS! But be careful, once the ice does start to melt and you're trying to pour your drink, the melted ice will get all over... I kind of made a mess...

The places is pretty small. It's definitely a date night type of spot. Even an outing for you and three friends. But I would not suggest for a party of more than 4.

2019,"My girlfriend and I came here for my birthday. The food was great! Izakaya dishes that did extremely well in the flavor of each dish. We tried two different wagyu beef dishes. One was incredibly tender with a hint of beef mixed in ponzu sauce. The other dish was a wagyu beef nigiri which was my personal favorite.

The corn with green tea salt was also another one of my favorites. There was so much flavor in every bite and the texture.of it was the perfect amount of crisp.

The salad was great too. A healthy dish that was served with sashimi which they didn't skimp out on. I feel like restaurants often skimp out on the salad, but we had more than enough.

The pork belly was great. Slightly chewy with a ton of flavor. The beef tongue was very tender and tasted almost like American barbeque. I highly recommend visiting the restaurant.

P.s. extensive sake menu (although most of the sake is pretty expensive, but they have two affordable sake bottles)",5.0

Dishes are original and rich and thoughtful curated. I'm honestly surprised they don't charge more for some seeming so crafty. The foie gras don is so delicious and rich. It's small but packs so much flavor while the rice is soft. The corn tempura is crisp and salty and fresh. Snow crab and broccolini was refreshing.

The restaurant is small but popular, so expect no less than an hour wait. I usually order the sashimi special, the wagyu beef, clam & cilantro ramen, the cod, chirashi bowl, and those spoonful scoops of uni & masago!

2018,"Recommendations: Everything. The restaurant is quite small, so the wait makes sense. They have a cute, Japanese-style interior that reminds me of izakayas in Japan. Moreover, considering how busy the restaurant is, the service is great. This place is on the pricey side for the area, so do keep that in mind.

Food: You seriously can't go wrong with any food item at Kiraku. Some of my friends find many of the dishes salty, but they're still good. My favorites are: Pork Belly Skewer, Yuba Spoons, Sashimi platters, Squid, Corn Tempura, mini Kaisen Donburi, Miso Eggplants, broccolini with snow crab and uni, and the grapefruit ice cream.

Drinks: For those who like sweet alcohol, I highly recommend the strawberry sake, so good! All of my friends love the strawberry sake. Furthermore, another one of my general favorite sweet sake is ""Mio,"" but it's not as sweet as the strawberry sake.

2018,"Words can not justify the heaven I tasted tonight.  This has to be THE BEST experience I've had in my 47 years of sushi obsession.

I started with the traditional seaweed salad - just the right seasoning with fresh (no fishy) seaweed, leaving a delightful crunch in every chew.  The seared cod eggs were something I've never had before and were a great opener to get that brininess you would expect from the sea with a balance of grated radish.

But when the main tapas dishes came, I was floored!  You MUST get the Yuma - two large spoons brimming with ikura (salmon eggs) and uni (sea urchin).  I have NEVER witnessed such freshness...the eggs and urchin goodness melted in my mouth and the were...dare I say...juicy?  It was almost as if I could have sipped the nectar of this fine dish from a straw.  At the urge of swallowing quickly, I instead savored the taste by biting into each delicately juicy egg.  Then came the wagu nigiri with uni and tuna cheeks, both melt-in-your-mouth morsels.  I was astounded at the tenderness of the sea bass and snapper; usually these fish cuts are a bit sinewy - not at all here...perfect texture and taste.

The green tea custard with red bean and hot tea was the perfect finish.  Bravo!  Thank you for the best experience yet in Cal!  

WARNING:  You MUST get reservations.  This establishment is so popular, it will fill up by 5:30pm, pretty much immediately after opening.  Expect one table to take 1.5 hrs to finish eating as this is a tapas style service, so tables will continue to order as the evening goes on and they still have room left in their bellies!

UPDATE (8/14/18):  Wish I could give higher marks than a 5-Star!  I was blessed to return to this rare gem, to try MORE wonderfully unique dishes!  My new favorites were the beef tongue skewer (SO TENDER!) and black cod (literally melt in your mouth grilled sweetness.

The restaurant is relatively small, but cozy, and the servers were extremely nice. We ordered the takowasabi, yuba, ceviche, roasted duck, chicken kaarage, and maze gohan, and here are the two dishes I highly recommend:

- takowasabi: raw octopus with wasabi. Though the dish wasn't the prettiest, it was definitely one of the tastiest throughout the night. The octopus legs were in small chunks, coated all throughout with the the refreshing taste and spiciness of wasabi.

- roasted duck: the roasted duck was meaty with little fat. Every bite was soft and tender, and the dish was perfectly seasoned.

2019,"My favorite reataurant in Berkeley!! Have been going to this place for at least 5 years now. Prices has not gone up much and food is still excellent!!

If you spend more than $40/person, you can make a reservation to avoid a long line. I once waited like 2 hours to be seated without reservation, so highly recommend to make a reservation. It is pretty easy to hit $40/person with sake + food. Walk-in cutomers now also have minimum $15/person and $20/person for part of 6 or more.

My usual orders are:
- Garlic Edamame: I usually don't order edamame at the restaurant, but you will be happy to spend $5 on this. Can be salty sometimes but really goes well with beer/sake!
- Tsumami Sampler: you can choose 3 from the list. I usually get Karasumi, Aburi Mentaiko and Takowasabi. These are really good with sake or beer! Takowasabi is highly recommended and you don't need to order as a sampler.
- Deluxe Chazuke: Must order! The best way to wrap up the dinner. Warm dashi broth with grilled salmon to aburi mentaiko as toppings.
- Clam and Cilantro Ramen: on the salty side but rich clam tastes and cilantro goes so well!
- Oyako Don: i mean, chicken, egg and rice, how can it go wrong! Well flavored!!
- Cartilage: i like this way more than chicken karage. Good texture and not too salty. Such a good beer food
- Corn Tempura with Geeen Tea Salt
- Beef Intestine Skewer: such a good sauce and well grilled with smoky flavor as well. My husband dows not eat intestine and this is only one he would actually eat!
- Jumbo Squid: teriyaki sauce + japanese mayo goes so well grilled jumbo squid. The meat is so soft!
- Baby Scallop Skewer: omg, this is usually on daily special, please order. Very fresh and butteru taste! Had to order one more.
- Red Snapper Head: usually very limited, maybe they only serve 2-3 dishes per day. I always get this when I can. Meats are tender and even daikon is super well seasoned. This dish makes me want to order a bowl of white rice!

Things I did not really enjoy:
- Roasted duck Kiraku style: nothing special anout the dish. Get pecking duck from Great China
- Grilled Angus Beef Tongue: rather order Tender Beef Tongue Skewer
- Baby squid: super salty and too fermented for my taste

2018,"Came to Kirarku over 8+ years ago but I guess I forgot to write a review back then. I remember it being really good so I suggested it to a few friends and we ended up coming on a Friday after work. They don't take reservations unless you spend a minimum of $40 per person. We didn't want to have to be tied into that so we ended up just walking in and waiting for about an hour, but we ended up spending more than that.... so probably would have been a better idea.

- corn tempura
- fried garlic
- albacore tataki
- grilled beef tongue
- roasted duck kiraku style
- jumbo squid
- deluxe chazuke

- and of course a bottle of sake to pair with everything :)

You have to try all of the foods on skewers, especially the beef tongue and the pork belly. They are both so tender and rich and full of flavor. Each order only comes with one skewer, but there is a good amount of meat on each skewer and it's surprisingly filling. The sashimi special was also very good. They had the classics like tuna and salmon, but they also had more interesting dishes like bonito. Each fish had a distinct flavor and they were all smooth and buttery.

----------------------------------------------------

My wife had a sudden craving for some traditional Japanese izakaya. Having tried the other place in Berkeley where we thankfully did not get salmonella poisoning but still left feeling crappy because it wasn't as good as advertised, we decided to try Kiraku with no reservations.

I will pause here and say that I blame no one but ourselves for showing up on a Saturday night without a reservation thinking that we could simply waltz in and grab a seat in the tiny space that Kiraku operates.

In fact, when we showed up at 5:20 pm, there was already a waiting list and of course we did not get seated with the first wave when the doors opened at 5:30. The Japanese lady that was in charge of seating told everyone that didn't make the first wave that the wait would be an hour or more... Damn that ""or more"", because oh did we ever wait ""or more"".

It turned out that the ""or more"" ended up being a 2-hour long wait of torture of hoping people on the list ahead of us would give up as well as me mad-dogging people through the window so that the mofos dining would hurry the Fukushima up.

Of course, the wife and I waited 2 hours not thinking the wait would be that Fukuda long... Because most places overestimate the wait time... Had we known... sigh... but the longer we waited we were Fukuoka committed.

And then it hit me. This was as bad as showing up to the DMV without an appointment. You see, just when you think seats are clearing up, Fukusaki diners with reservations show up! And then, you're back in the idle queue.

When we were finally seated, we knew exactly what we wanted to order since we had 2 hours to literally memorize the menu and to study other people's photos (OPP) on Yelp. I'm down with the food porn that is OPP, yea you know me.

We ordered a 720 ml of sake to drown away the pain and sorrow of FML waiting and promptly ordered the 3 for $10 sampler (takowasabi, seared spciy cod roe, fermented firefly squid) as well as beef intestine skewers, lamb shoulder skewers, a tempura fish special, and wagyu tataki.

I wish I could say the food was worth the wait... but 2 hours is way too Fukuyama long. But yes, the food was authentic and delicious and we gobbled up every Fukuroi thing.

Next time I'm calling ahead and making reservations. Just remember that if you make reservations, there is a $40 minimum per person. In other words, stingy diners that drink the free tea and tap water, you need to order drinks. After all, it's a Fukuzawa izakaya!

* When you order a bottle of sake, they bring out a platter of handmade ceramic sake cups that you can choose from. Pretty Fukuma kawaii~~~

* Waiting at Kiraku was almost as long as this one time when I waited 2+ hours for a hot dog in Chicago at the now defunct Hot Doug's. Like Hot Doug's, I was surprised that there was no separate Yelp listing called Kiraku's Waiting Line (yelp.com/biz/hot-dougs-w…).

* Fukue you to the parents that bring kids to an izakaya and have them play on their i-retard-phones taking up space that could otherwise be occupied by responsible alcoholic adults like this guy.

* There sure are a ton of Japanese cities that start with Fuku- Hahaha. Fukuhahaha would be awesome city name BTW.",5.0

2019,"Such a cute little busy spot. This place has solid, seasonally fresh Japanese small bites/ tapas. It's great to go to try new dishes or introduce a friend to more traditional Japanese fare as opposed to your average quick sushi place. You wont find over-riced rolls covered in tempura and sweet sauces here. They have bomb sashimi options and my go-to at the start every meal is the Chef's Choice. You can always judge the quality of seafood a Japanese restaurant is serving by the quality of their uni and Kiraku's does not disappoint.
With that being said the majority of their plates are prepared/cooked and grilled delights that will also appeal to those that like the diversity of trying new food but don't particularly prefer sushi and raw seafood. This isn't a sushi spot, so no worries there are lots of grilled and fried options to delight in. The tuna cheek being one of my favorite!
Keep in mind that this is such a tiny place but definitely worth going! It's designed in a traditional Japanese style with a sliding door entry.

2018,"Make a reservation if you can or get there before they open. Restaurant is small and fills up fast. We got there about 10 minutes before they opened and just missed the first round so we had to wait 45min before being seated. So worth it though. If you don't want to tget the uni spoons got for the mini kaisen donburi. you get most of the same things except maybe less uni, but it's also more filling and I like eating my ikura with some rice. Unagi chawanmushi was real silky with good flavor from the unagi. I feel like the mushrooms could have been soaked for a longer period of time though. Potatoe beef croquette was nice and crispy on the outside and not clumpy on the inside. Black cod was a little disappointing to me. The sauce was very good however I was hoping for it to be a bit more broiled and the texture was a little more on the chewy side. What was really good was their chef special sashimi. bluefin tuna was so gooood.

We arrived at the restaurant at around 6:30 and didn't get seated until close to 9 pm. They did inform us though that as long as we put our name down before 9 that they'd seat us even though the restaurant closes at 9.

Among the three of us, we ordered about 10 dishes including a few of their popular dishes - rock shrimp tempura, corn tempura, and mini kaisen don. Nothing particularly stood out except for the roasted duck and beef tataki. Was very unimpressed with their bland Kim-chi and blue fin hot pot. The food did come out fairly quickly and service was average. I definitely don't think it was worth waiting 2.5 hours and won't probably return unless reservations are made.",3.0
2019,"Kind of a disappointment.

My friend and I tried this place on a pretty busy night. Everything was fresh, tasted fine, and normal. This place is good for a somewhat nicer Berkeley restaurant, but I think Musashi is better.

We ordered:

-Corn tempura. Nice texture. Might order again.
-Salmon carpaccio. While the salmon and tomato was a curious combination, I would not order this again. Personally, the sauce is a little too much for me. Stick to sashimi.

-Wagyu beef. Pretty good. The spicy sauces were great.

-Osaka taro potato. Think boiled taro with takoyaki sauce. Will never order again. Why would you serve something like this???

-Beef tongue skewer. Okay. Nothing special.

-Pork belly skewer. I liked this! A little too salty.

I feel like Kiraku is informally known for its tapas, but after trying a little of everything, I think you're better off sharing a fish collar and a small appetizer. (Or order something different). The fact that their corn tempura was the best part of our meal should say something about this place; i.e. focus on either your tapas experience or sashimi and try not to do both. I would also either make your portions slightly larger to make up for the price, or make them smaller and improve the quality. Everything was in a weird in-between where it wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't great.

Everything I ordered was not worth a second try. The waitress did pass by us with a fish collar that looked very interesting (see above paragraph), so we might come back for that.

There was no real highlight of the meal. If you're super into Japanese tapas, I would go somewhere else. If you're looking to see what the hype is about, I'd come here once.

Finally, the ambiance was mediocre. For some reason, they don't play music, and while the staff was friendly/attentive, for a place that seems to pride itself on being Berkeley's gem, I don't see or feel anything that proves this theory. Not only that, but the place is small and loud. Not in a cozy, intimate way either.",3.0

2017,"After months of consecutive- I'm first on their top check-in's!! Now that we are a regular, I noticed that the services has been improved and the food just keep on getting better.

What is special at Kiraku is that they have different special items on the menu everyday- it's like a surprise every time. Sometimes they have A5 wagyu beef shabu, amberjack fish shabu, or steamed hairy crab... their menu is different every week and it depends on whatever they have bought in fresh that week. Also, I heard that many of their ingredient products are imported from Japan/other places so pricing might reflect why their dishes are sometimes a little high. My all time favorite here will be their famous YUBA (spoons of fresh uni, tofu skin, and sea urchin) that is just party in my mouth. Their corn tempura is also amazing, it is fried just the right way.

Parking here might be hard to find but it is definitely worth trying here. Be sure to come early to put your name down! :D",5.0
2017,"Ippuku in downtown Berkeley gets lots of love and attention, but Kiraku is yet another izakaya that's quite popular for good reason. While Kiraku's venue is nowhere near as gorgeous and atmospheric as Ippuku's, I think the overall experience is a bit more satisfying, mainly because of the value you get here.

To start, a sashimi assortment was fairly fresh, with each fish's underlying flavor coming through. Hot items like grilled pork and beef skewers, as well as the adegashi tofu and organic chicken karraage, were all tasty and highly satisfying. Some homemade ice cream for dessert was a nice way to round out the meal.

Overall, prices were fairly reasonable given the portion sizes and dish quality, and service was fast and efficient enough, although not particularly warm or engaging. Still, if the wait isn't too long here, it's a very dependable izakaya.",5.0

2017,"It hurts me to say this but the izakaya experience has gotten a bit worse here. Been coming for years and I was ready to write off the last time I was here as an anomaly but then I came again and was disappoint yet again. The service has gotten worse and sloppier, without paying much attention unless you constantly wave them down. But more importantly, the food quality has diminished. That oomph and top notch flavor that put Kiraku above the rest is gone. Perhaps there is a new chef still figuring it out or the quality of the food just got worse. Whatever the reason, Kiraku is still one of the best in the Bay Area, but I'd say this place went from a 4.75 to 4 stars.

2018,"One of the gems in Berkeley area! This isn't the American Japanese kind of restaurants where you'll find rolls and stuff, but a rather traditional Japanese izakaya.

AMBIENCE 4/5: Super small and cozy Japanese restaurant, always busy. Don't think they take reservations, and the wait list is done by paper, so you'll see a lot of people waiting outside for their names to be called.
I came here with a party of 3 on a weekday after 8pm, and still had to wait 20+ minutes.

PRO TIP: Do come prepared with cash if you can, because the restaurant charges a credit card fee ($5 I think).

SERVICE 5/5: very friendly Japanese ladies, and food was served promptly.

FOOD 4/5: We ordered the chawamushi, grilled beef tongue, roasted duck, yuzu chicken udon, mini kaisen don and roasted tea blancmange for dessert. Chawamushi was pretty standard, still good but nothing special about it. Grilled beef tongue lacks a little flavor at first, but once you get to the bottom where the beef had a chance to soak up more juice it tasted better. Roasted duck and the yuzu chicken udon were my personal favorites. Duck was tender and juicy. While the yuzu chicken udon looked ordinary and nothing special, it tasted AMAZING. The faint taste of yuzu adds a nice little twist to the chicken broth, and the chicken was juicy as well. Mini kaisen don while small, but was packed with salmon, salmon roe and a little bit of uni, and was absolutely delicious. The dessert roasted tea blancmange was the perfect ending to our meal. The pudding tasted like traditional Japanese roasted tea, and very rich in flavor.

Overall I think the chawamushi and grilled beef tongue could be skipped, but definitely try out the other dishes I mentioned! Would come back again if I'm in the area.",4.0

2018,"Kiraku definitely lives up to its hype. Amazing food and amazing staff!

The wait is as crazy as other reviewers say. The restaurant is very small and people do take their sweet time there. You can make a reservation, but each guest will need to order a minimum of $40. We arrived here 15 mins before it opened and there was already a crowd of people waiting outside. Unfortunately, our party was unable to make it into the first seating, so we ended up waiting for 1.5 hours. Luckily, Kiraku is located in a busy part of Berkeley near campus, so there are plenty of shops you can spend your time at, and one of my favorite dessert places is directly across the street, uji time! Needless to say, we had dessert before dinner.

When we finally got seated, we ordered all of the popular items on the menu:

Wagyu tataki (3/5): overall wasn't bad, but also didn't live up to the hype for me since this was the main dish I came here for. Everyone was left underwhelmed

Suzuki (Japanese sea bass) carpaccio (5/5): this was by far the group's favorite. Amazing texture and even better flavor in the sauce.

Salmon carpaccio (5/5): fatty, melted in your mouth. Also amazing sauce.

Corn tempura (5/5): weirdly this was my personal favorite. Perfectly fried with a light batter. Amazing!

Pork belly skewer (3/5): a bit tough and lean for my liking. But good Smokey flavor

Kiraku Duck (4/5): good flavor, a little chewy

Premium angus beef tongue with truffle flavor (4/5): a bit chewy, but amazing truffle flavor

Mini Kaisen bowl (5/5): very small but everything in the bowl was quality. Overflowing with ikura and the uni was the sweetest I've had in a while.

Sweet potato brûlée (3/5): good favor but thicker texture and I didn't expect it to be cold inside

Attentive staff and great service as well. Overall, I would love to come back again, but next time maybe come 1 hour before it opens lol. Come with a group so you can share many dishes together!",5.0

Wow. It's been awhile since I've had a meal this good. My husband and I were already planning our second trip after the first dish. This place fully deserves its rave reviews.

A few logistics first:
Reservations can be made over the phone. They require that you commit to spending at minimum $40 per person if you make a reservation. It's not too hard to do with izikaya, and the long wait without a reservation makes it worth it in my book. Street parking only. Driving is always a bit of a hassle in Berkeley. I won't say that parking is plentiful and easy to come by, but it's still easier than SF.

Food:
You can close your eyes, point at a random menu item, and chances are that you'll receive something delicious. I'm not sure how they do it. I'm usually pretty excited when a place can serve up one foodgasmic course, but the foodgasms kept rolling in throughout our dinner. Everything is amazing, but our favorite was the salmon carpaccio. It was light, flavorful, well balanced, eye catching, and all around a fantastic dish. The crispy squid was a pleasant surprise for me. I usually expect crispy squid to be battered and fried in some way, but it was surprisingly not like that at all. I have no idea how they managed to achieve the texture they did. It was reminiscent of the snap you get with cartilage. Don't order the udon if you're aiming for lots of little dishes. It was delicious, but that one really fills you up. It is however the perfect choice if you're still feeling a little hungry near the end of you meal. The beef tongue was wonderfully tender and full of truffley goodness. Others have already shared their rave reviews for the yuba spoons, pork belly, and corn tempura. There's not much more to add. We rarely order dessert, but given how amazing the rest of our meal was, we decided to give it a try. The yuzu mochi was soft and pillowy with a delicate yuzu flavor. The grapefruit ice cream was very intensely grapefruit. My husband loves grapefruit and was excited by this but the texture was very icy.

Service was friendly and attentive. The space is quite small and tight, and probably only good for smaller parties.",5.0
2018,"This was easily the best meal I've had in a while - and especially in Berkeley. I came here a little apprehensive because of the price. I'm a student, and I don't usually spend this much money on food (despite my love for food). I got the corn tempura, chicken kaarage, sashimi (chef's choice), Buta-kim (pork and kimchee with fried egg), wagyu beef taiyaki, scallion and beef pancake, bluefish tuna cheek meat, and black pork belly skewer. Needless to say, for two people we ordered too much.

We started with the sashimi, which was the best sashimi I've ever had. I guess that's not saying much, because I haven't seeked out a lot of sashimi places (I didn't like sashimi until recently), but this fish tasted so fresh and sweet and buttery and DELICIOUS. Then, we got the corn tempura which, I mean it's fried corn, how could you go wrong? Then we got the chicken kaarage, which was great, but I'm not sure if it was $9 good. I will say the chicken meat itself was extremely moist, but I felt like there wasn't quite enough crunch to it. Also, the accompanying sauce was too mayo-heavy. I wished it had more of a Japanese mustard ""kick"" to it. Then we got the pork belly skewer and wagyu beef. The pork belly tasted just like korean barbecue pork belly (ssamgyupsaal), served with a korean chili miso paste (ssamjang). It was good, but not outstanding for the amount I paid. The wagyu beef was amazing. I cannot wait to return to this restaurant to eat more of it. I've never been one to eat medium rare meat (I know, I know - all the food critics in the world are rolling their eyes now), but this had an amazing ginger soy flavor and it was cut so thinly and expertly. The scallions and beef pancake wasn't that great - too salty and doughy and nothing that amazing about it. I thought the tuna cheek would be taiyaki (seared, but not cooked through), but it was cooked all the way through which was a bit disappointing. However, it was pretty good - nothing standout though.

All in all, the food here was delicious and the service was great! If I came here again, I'd order more sashimi and wagyu beef, and maybe try a few new dishes too! Definitely recommend. Make reservations for weekends and holidays, because the restaurant is small and is very popular!

2018,"I've been to Kiraku a total of four times to date and every time it manages to taste better than the last time I was there: a humongous feat!

Just a tip: if you want to avoid having to wait in line when it opens and risk having to be turned away until the second seating, please make a reservation! They do have a $40 minimum when you do, but trust that you'll be able to spend that amount without a problem. With that said, this is definitely my splurge treat on special occasions :)

Must orders:
- sashimi salad: very generous and fresh fish portions with a zesty onion dressing. This is honestly cheaper than ordering a sashimi platter ( also delicious, but $$$$)

- corn tempura: it's on everyone's list, and should be on yours too!

- buta kim ( pork and kimchi with poached egg ). I actually like to mix this with the yaki udon, which is a different menu item ( basil pesto sauce ) for my own naughty creation!

- mini Kaisen donburi ( salmon, ikura, uni, snow crab) which is also a better deal than sashimi!

- tofu uni spoons: eat it all in one spoonful for an explosion of flavor!

- grapefruit ice cream (unbeatably creamy and zesty) and the perfect end to the meal

And that's a wrap!",5.0
2017,"4.5/5
I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.

Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.

Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.

For our meal we got the following:
1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)

2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)

3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)

4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).

5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).

6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)

7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)

Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!",5.0
2018,"The reviews are definitely legit.  The wait on a Sunday evening is around 30mins min.  If we are talking about straight Japanese tapas, this place destroys ippuku simply because it delivers on flavor and execution alone.  Try the sea bass carpaccio, lamb shoulder skewers and the grilled cod (like butter), the uni spoons were delicious.  Avoid the deep fried cartilage and the mapo tofu(special).  As for the drinks, this place has a affordable pricing on junmai daigingos which is rare.  The one setback to this place is circulation given the amount of grilled items they have and the small space. The service was friendly and attentive.  Would definitely come back.

Starring with the yuba spoons, we took back any words about eating $6 in one mouthful. It was a fresh, luxurious, seafoody taste. Then we have the roast duck, which was smokey, tender, and paired well with the sauce. The egg custard we got was a little underwhelming and a very small portion for the price (I make this at home, which might be why I was not as impressed by this dish) and the noodles are simple and flavorful, just as they should be.

Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person).

Food - Alright.

Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.

Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.

Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.

Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable.

Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go.

Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland.

Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison.

Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time.

Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max.

The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious.

2018,"It was the most disappointing experience after all the hype on yelp over this place. I did very through research and picked all the famous dishes mentioned on yelp and found them all to very average. Definitely have had better versions of these dishes elsewhere.

Considering the price of the items and all the hype on yelp, I expected much more. Will not be returning.",3.0
2017,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list.

We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol.

The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:

-Jumbo squid: excellent!
-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something).
-Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did).
-Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so.

We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha!

Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5.",4.0

2017,"I would have never thought a place like this exists in Berkeley!  Truly, I wouldn't.  Come as early as you can so you can write your name, unless you have reservations, because they get packed, reallllll quick.  A tiny, hole in the wall-ish location.

Everything in the menu looked amazing.  This is what we had (pretty much loved everything):
**Chef's special; sashimi: we misunderstood how this came, they told us it was two orders minimal of 5; 7; or 9 and I thought they meant two plates. Instead you get two slices (unless u order more). anyways, we went with the 5 option and it came with snapper, scallop, salmon, big eye tuna, and black snapper.  The big eye tuna was fatty, and melted in your mouth.  Black snapper was flavorful.  All of the fishes were sushi grade, fresh quality and I was left very happy.
**Duck: these were tinier bits that expected but they still did the job.  with scallions and a tasty sauce drizzled on top, not overcooked, but it was great.  It wasn't a 10/10 but I'd definitely try this out.
**Tuna tartare: the presentation of this dish was beautiful.  Given with crispy seaweed, wasabi and seaweed and sprouts it is recommended you make a hand roll.  The tartare was so flavorful and was amazing, wish we got two orders.
**Rock shrimp tempura: big pieces of shrimp.  you can't go wrong with rock shrimp, honestly.  these were spicy but addicting.
**wagyu beef with foie gras sushi:  this was disappointing. very thin layer of wagyu over foie gras topped with a lot of crunch.  Crunch was unnecessary, foie gras was not enough, and wagyu was pretty tasteless.  The yuzu it comes with is overwhelming.  DONT dip it in any more sauce, in addition.

I'll one hundred percent be back here on any visit as it's a nice spot to dine.  I'll definitely try making reservations ahead of time though to spare myself any wait time.",5.0

However, it costed a lot compare to other places even though we didn't drink. The place is for a couple to visit on their dates, not for a family to visit like us. If you are looking for a place to have small bites with drinks in a friendly place, this place can be perfect. For a family outing, I would not recommend.",4.0
2017,"Dining area is a bit cramped and noisy, but the food was the bigger distraction. It's probably best to dine here during the week rather than on the weekend.

To name a few, we had crab uni salad, yaki udon, sashimi snapper, karaage, and curry flavored fish.

2017,"With over 600 stellar reviews it would be redundant to exalt the attributes of Kiraku. Rather this review are some tips for future diners on a better experience.

The food is simple all small dishes, so don't expect to be filled up with 2 or 3 dishes.
Large selection of sakes and beer is offered in pitchers.
Make a reservation, go early or get ready to wait.
Order a majority of your dishes right away some take time to come out.
Kiraku is tiny and cramped so it is not a great place fir large parties.
Get in line for the 1 restroom or you will lose your place in line, there are chairs outside for the wait.
Service is efficient but they are busy, try to get your requests in together.
The ambiance is not a quiet date night location. Bright florescent lights, busy servers, a drinking crowd, and plenty of people waiting for your table make a long dinners impossible.
Not a cheap meal with the small dishes and high end sakes.  
Street parking only and it hit or miss in that area of Berkeley.

2017,"Service
So you write your name on a list outside and wait to be called. My friend and I were 3rd on the list, and it took a little over 30 minutes before we got seated. Once inside, we were greeted and served. They really do wait till you finish all of your food before they bring out the check, which is nice as we didn't feel rushed.

Food
There is a main menu, and a there is an additional daily tapa menu. We had asked the waitress how much she thought we needed for 2 people, and she said 4-5 plates. For our small plates, we ordered corn tempura, eihre karaage(stingray fin), beef tongue, roasted duck, and tuna/foi gras. I've never had stingray fin before and we found it to taste like fish. Overall, we found the food to be flavorful, and it was the perfect portion. For dessert, we had mochi, which you can tell was really fresh!

-Wagyu beef tataki
-beef tongue skewer (may not sound pleasant to some but trust me, it's bomb)
-corn tempura
-maze gohan (fried rice with salmon, so good)
-sweet potato brulee for dessert.
Staff are very attentive, it's a small intimate place so probably not best for a large group. Wait time to be seated was about 10 minutes and you have to wait outside (so bring a jacket if its chilly). There's one unisex restroom, and street parking which was difficult for us to find a slot.

2017,"I was here for the second time this past Friday for my birthday. This dinner was more awesome than the first time I was here minus the 2 hour wait. By some miracle, I left a message to make reservations that morning, which required $40 min per person and I received a call around 5pm to confirm my reservation. I was expecting to get stuck with some crappy time but It seemed like I had first dibs which made my night!

The crowd was already forming in front of the restaurant when I got there. I checked in with the staff and we got seated 5 min after our reservation so not bad.

WHAT WE ORDERED:

- corn tempura ($5) - must get! one of my favorite dishes. I inhaled it at sight and forgot to take a pic. Yea, it's that good. It's crunchy, sweet and I love how the kernels of corn pop in your mouth.

- chicken cartilage ($8)- must get! extra crunchy cartilage. Awwwwyeah.

- snow crab and broccolini $12) - I guess I needed some veggies and I'm a sucker for anything uni but this was a meh for me.

- steamed clams with butter ($10) - I'm not typically a clam lover but they did this right. Little sweet clams soaked in a bath of buttery broth. Make sure to enjoy some of that broth!

- suzuki carpaccio ($12) - must get! yummy and fresh stripped bass with just the right amount of yuzu and seasoning.

- tuna collar bone ($32) - must get! I saw this dish through the window while I was waiting and immediately knew I had to get this. It was so damn good, rich, fatty, and the exterior of the fish was toasted perfectly with the right amount of char. I'm drooling just thinking about this.

- premium angus beef tongue ($18) must get! - just when I thought I hit my max limit of food consumption I couldn't help going back for more. This was the perfect marbleization, sear, and texture. The truffle flavoring and the slight crunch was pure perfection.

- green tea ice cream ($8) - must get! a huge scoop of ice cream with a mochi, red bean, and whip cream on the side. This combo reminded me of a japanese crepe filling and I loved every bite of it!

- Hakkaisan Sake 750 ml ($45) - when you got 2 drinkers and lots of good food a bottle is a must! It lasted us post dessert. The fun part was picking out our sake glasses which came in different colors and sizes. I ordered this sake the last time I was here and loved it! It's smooth, clean, crisp and very easy to drink.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Thanks for creating a great experience! I can't wait to come back again!",5.0

2017,"My favorite restaurant in berkeley, hands down.

Everything I've had here is so delicious but there are several stand outs.

Tuna collar. This was a special item 35$. A very large portion about the size of two large fanned out hands. I would say easily shareable for four people. The bone was so crisp it was like a salty fish crouton. The meat was juicy and buttery. there were these crisp areas of skin clinging to the bone and everything about this is decadent!

Shime Saba. (torched mackerel sashimi) Best mackerel I've ever had. Light and soft buttery texture. Salty mackerel flavor sliced in a way that you can stuff each piece with a little bit of ginger and green onion. The torched top gave it that firey flavor.

Wagyu beef + Uni Nigiri. Ate this guy in one bite after painting on dabs of soy sauce onto the beef. Each chew lent a new layer of flavor. At first, clean and light, then creamy and sweet from the uni, then spicy from a horse radish sauce tucked in the middle.

Corn tempura. I'm not quite sure how they go about making this! The corn is so lightly battered, it tastes like popcorn at first and fresh sweet corn to finish.  The fry reminds me of a carnival for some reason, in a good way.

Absolutely if you have room for dessert, get the Roasted Tea Blanc Manger. If you don't get this, you're a fool! This dessert is simply sublime. The flavor is so light. If you like sugary things, this may not impress you bc the flavors are more subtle. The texture is soft and creamy and it comes in a tiny delicate black box like a piece of jewelry. The only flaw is that the container it comes in makes it difficult to spoon the cream out from its corners.",5.0
2017,"I wanted to introduce my boyfriend to Japanese food and I'm glad I picked Kiraku to do so.
Make sure you arrive as soon as they open because their wait is ridiculous. It is VERY small inside. We waited for over an hour and we didn't get a precise time frame on seating. You basically write your own name on the clipboard outside and hope that you can catch an employee to give you an estimate.
But, everything was so fresh and delicious!

We ordered....
Garlic Edamame
Corn Tempura, MUST TRY! Delish!
Fried Chicken Karaage
Rock Shrimp Tempura w/ Mayo, great flavor!
Roasted Duck Kiraku Style

The only con about this place is that it's a little pricier than other nearby Japanese places. But it was worth it!!!

They give you a warm towel to wipe your hands before your meal (which is really comforting to have after being outside in the cold for a while).

We ordered the beef tataki, corn fritters, and mini don. All were surprisingly very good and we wanted MORE! The mini don was my favorite! The fish on it was so fresh and without that fishy taste. The flavors molded well together! We also ordered the sweet potato creme brûlée for dessert and the greedy person inside of me did not want to share! It was delicious!!

We had the corn tempura (love that they gave us an extra Bc we had 3 in our party), the black pork belly skewers (major hit in our party, much so we ordered a few more), the roasted duck skewer (one of my favs), sashimi, the tofu sea urchin dish, the chicken karaage, blue fin tuna cheek, potatoe croquettes, waygu beef, and a few other items. Washed it down with some sake and Orion beer. For dessert we had the yuzu mochi and green tea ice cream.

Whatever you do, order the fried corn. The chicken karaage is also a huge win. The salmon sashimi was also heavenly.

2017,"I've passed by Kiraku on several occasions since my go-to Thai restaurant, is on the same block. There's ALWAYS a wait so I thought I'd finally come see what all the fuss was about.

Came here on a rainy Friday and there were about 5 groups ahead of us. The place is tiny which explains the long waits.

As for the menu, Kiraku offers a variety of japanese tapas. Each order serves about two people so it can add up quiet a bit. I believe we spent about $130 between four and we were all still pretty hungry afterwards.

As far as taste goes, there were a few dishes that were quiet tasty. The Simmered Pork w/ Braised Half Boiled Egg was really good and was the one dish that stood out to me.

We also got the Tempura corn, Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage, Edamame.

The food was good just wish there was more of it",3.0
2017,"Came here last night for a birthday dinner for my parents. I would definitely recommend making reservations. I called about a month in advance and the only seating available was 5:45 and 8:45. We opted for 5:45. We arrived around 5:30 (opening time) and there was already a huge crowd forming outside.

First impressions:
Restaurant is small and casual. Menu had a number of interesting options typical of an izakaya. Service was generally attentive.

We ordered:
Agedashi taro potato
Black pork belly skewer
Tender beef tongue skewer
Saba shio
Jumbo squid
Grilled rice ball
Yaki udon
Chef's choice sashimi platter
Yuzu mochi

The highlights were the Chef's choice sashimi platter, agedashi taro potato, tender beef tongue skewer and grilled rice balls. The sashimi platter was so fresh and the fish was flavorful. To describe a fish as tasting sweet might sound odd but there was definitely a natural sweetness to the meat. The best piece by far was the torro (tuna belly). Torro is typically a fatty version of tuna and can be overwhelming to the palette at times but the torro here was perfectly balanced between fat, flavor and the refreshing quality of tuna.

The agedashi taro potato was spot on. I loved the balance between the mochi outer shell and the mashed taro and potato inside. The sauce was also well-balanced and complimented the taro/potato. This is comfort food, through and through.

The tender beef tongue was definitely tender but it was not mush. There was still texture to it even though it practically melts in your mouth. The grill flavors and marinade is also very apparent and those elements elevate the already perfectly cooked beef tongue.

Finally, the rice balls were amazing. Beautiful grill flavor and the surprisingly but welcome use of spicy miso sauce. Typically, a soy-based sauce is used to baste the rice ball but I love the spicy miso sauce. The pickles provided with the rice balls make it such a perfect bite.

All the other dishes we ordered were flavorful and cooked well. The only dish I wasn't too sure about was the yaki udon. Because it says ""yaki"", I was expecting a pan-fried noodle but instead, we got udon with pesto soup. It was too liquidy for a yaki udon and the pesto seemed weird with Japanese food. It tasted fine but personally, it didn't vibe with the other dishes.

Overall, would definitely come here again and try their other offerings. Again, reservations are a must unless waiting outside in the cold for extended periods of time is your idea of fun.",5.0
2018,"Ate here this evening. The wait was about an hour outside. SO WORTH IT. We started with two sake samplers. Then the fried corn, which is going to be better than you think. Must try.

We knew that there would be a long wait so made a reservation. Highly recommend making a reservation before you go.
Parking at night time is easier than the day time.
We parked on the street. After 6pm, the meters are free.

I am Japanese and have to say that I loved the food here.
""Authentic"" is the word I can proudly say.

The details of each dish were impeccable and perfectly seasoned and prepared.
Obviously, this place is owned by Japanese owners.

Sashimi 5 kind were one of the best fish we had and we have eaten in Tsukizi.
Freshness was the best and they were so sweet. Absolutely mind-blowing!

Another one of my favorites was beef tongue. It comes in sizzling cast iron plate and the flavor and seasoning was over the top.

Small kaisen donburi $15 was smaller than I expected, but ikura was so fresh that it was popping in my mouth.

Yuba which is served in tiny spoons was also amazing. Little spoonful of delightfulness. I don't know why it's called Yuba which actually means thin tofu skin.

Skewers were also very tasty.

Giant squid is better than expected and was so good. Very very fresh squid. Good for your jaw exercises.

The website talks about the izakaya dining experience, sounds exciting, right? However, someone (me, I suppose) should inform the owners of Kiraku that dining experience means more than just cramming people in a room, serving them food, taking their money, and asking their customers to leave.

Can we talk about service?

Can we talk about atmosphere?

Can we talk about a little common courtesy?

2018,"Kiraku is probably the best izakaya in the Bay. Food comes out quickly and is cooked to perfection. Corn tempura and anchovy broccoli are not to be missed. If your feeling like a little splurge, try the seared Wagyu beef with foie gras or uni!

The restaurant is on the smaller side, so if you have a large party, be sure to make a reservation (Note: reservations must make an order limit per person). Otherwise, be ready to wait 45+ min on a weekday and 1.5+ on a weekend night. Ambiance is casual cool.

Street parking only, so try your luck. The food is definitely worth the risk.",5.0
2017,"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants. I been here multiple times during my undergrad years. The restaurant is small, so arrive before 5:30 pm or be prepared to wait without a reservation.

My favorite order to get here is the black cod. The fish just melts in your mouth and the flavor is just right.

I would highly recommend the corn tempura, beef tongue, pork belly, and duck as well. The only thing I wouldn't order again is their udon. The broth was bland. All their tapas I tried never disappointed me though!",5.0
2017,"""You get what you pay for"" isn't really the term I would use here, as you get way more bang for the buck. It's more like ""You get what you WAIT for"".

I suggest that if you don't make a prior reservation with this place, that you plan to wander around Berkeley for 1-2 hours before you even have a chance to try out their delicious food. Otherwise, you will be banging your head on the side of the street - or you can just go to the dispensary next door and grab something to help you wait ;)

In any case, this place is a bit small and is somewhat packed inside so there isn't much wiggle room. The servers were genuinely nice and very helpful in recommending some good stuff:

- SASHIMI SALAD: This is definitely something I would recommend to a stranger. The fish was so sweet and savory while it was laid on some fresh greens. However, with the influx of the Poke trend, the taste is more familiar to me now than it was back when I had this same salad nearly 3 years ago. A winner nonetheless!

- CORN TEMPURA w/ GREEN TEA SALT: I really liked it, but I ask myself, is it just because I love tempura and corn? Even if that's so, it is still a genius idea to put them together and have it shaped so nicely and presentable.

- AGEDASHI TARO POTATO: This is a personal favorite - The taste was pretty unique to me as I have never tasted a taro potato dish before, especially with all these different flavors. There were shavings of something else on top with some sauce drizzled over it.

- ORGANIC CHICKEN KARAAGE: It's advertised as bite size - that must be for Shaquille O' Neal, because it took 4 bites for me. Personally, I thought this one was good and very filling but it didn't get the same response from my cousin. First off, she isn't a fan of mayonnaise and given that it is the primary dip for this dish, she wasn't too taken on it. ""The chicken is kinda bland"", she said. I liked the subtle taste of the seasoning personally but no two people are alike.

- BLACK BELLY SKEWER w/ SPICY MISO SAUCE: This is a great 'tapas style' dish to have as you keep waiting for other dense foods. Just a small single skewer with 5 chunks of meat and delicious sauce on the side.

- BEEF SIRLOIN SKEWER w/ APPLE SAUCE: What juicy meat! Another good side dish while you wait for some main events.

- WAGYU BEEF TATAKI: High quality beef comes with some high quality taste. It seemed like every bite I had was heaven to me. It's like small shavings of some good beef (mildly rare) spread out on a plate in kind of a flower pattern.

- BUTCHERS CROCQUETTES: These are like deep fried potato patties. Who wouldn't want these?! Hahaha :)

- GRILLED RICE BALL: These actually came in large triangles, but WOW did this dish surprise me with how good it was! It was so crispy and tasty, for something that at the start just looked like well shaped steamed rice.

So, in the end it was totally worth it. It took us a 20 minute walk to get that out of our systems. The best part? I paid less than $50 for my share, and with a place like this it seems like a total steal with the amount of items we got.",5.0

Was over in Berkeley for a concert and stumbled upon this location.

Tender beef tongue skewer - Amazing flavor to coat a generously sized tender beef tongue cut.
Sashimi - fresh and accompanied with unique condiments

- No refills on certain drinks
- Service was nice and attentive
- They take reservations with the contingency of spending $40 minimum/person

Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.

2017,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.

My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...

Ordered:
x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness.
x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet.
x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(
x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.
x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.
x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

The super downside...

x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...

For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes.",3.0
2016,"What a fantastic spot.  We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, a good example of a small plate restaurant that works.  I recommend the grilled squid, beef tatake, Suzuki carpaccio and, yes, the corn tempura is a must order. The flavors are bold and complex, the food complements each other well.  

It's not a beautiful restaurant by any stretch, so you should not come here for the ambiance.  But the other non-food related factors are done well, from pacing, service, and pricing.  Kiraku adds another reason as to why Berkeley is one of my favorite dining scenes.",5.0

The food and service here are phenomenal. If you are looking for a legit izakaya.. this is it. I ordered their house salad, corn tempura, agedashi tofu, pork belly, beef tongue, a bottle of sake, and a few other items on their menu which I dont see listed on their website. Everything was seasoned well, prepared beautifully, and delivered to our table in a timely manner. I would def recommend this place to others and come here again.",5.0

At first glance, you might be hesitant to give this place a try due to the long wait list this establishment normally has. However, you will soon realize that the food as well as service is well worth the 25-30 minute wait (on average).

My girlfriend and I wanted to try Japanese food in a way we haven't before and Kiraku delivered what we were looking for. Their menu is very simple and easily laid out. If you have any questions, the servers are more than happy to answer.

We had the Wagyu Sashimi, Deluxe Chazuke Bowl, Scallop skewers, strawberry sake and some fish roe shooters (forgive me, I forgot the name of this dish). Everything came out in relatively fast fashion and it all tasted exquisite! The dish for the night would have to be the Scallop Skewers. They were so tender and fresh that we ordered another round. The total of the bill was around $98, excluding tip. Overall, it was a great experience.",4.0

2017,"The hype is real.

I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***)

If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem.

My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu:

*Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!
*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this.
*Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people.
*Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite.
*Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.
*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.
*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love?

If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back!

2016,"My friends planned my birthday dinner at Kiraku and it's one of the best meals I've had in a long time! Pretty authentic izakaya, reasonably priced, with a great selection of drinks! I ordered the Fuji apple sake and it was super sweet for those of you who are lightweight like me.
We ordered almost half the menu (most dishes come in smaller sizes, so it gives you opportunity to try more!) and nothing was short of delicious. The ""after sake"" portion of the menu is where the carbs/bigger portions are, so they typically bring those out last. I highly recommend the corn tempura, lotus root chips and jumbo squid! There might be a wait when you arrive, but it's well worth it! I can't wait to come back. Thank you Kiraku, for a great birthday dinner",5.0
2018,"Came here to celebrate my birthday with a friend. There were plenty of open seats around 6pm on a Tuesday evening. We ordered the corn tempura, saba shio, shimmering beef and scallion pancake, and the yuzu chicken udon. The corn tempura with green tea salt was good - it's an interesting texture and flavor. The saba shio was crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. The beef/scallion pancake was interesting - it had some type of konnyaku cake cut up inside too (agar-like consistency). The udon had an interesting citrusy broth, but the noodles were slightly soggy and not chewy.  

I was unimpressed with the service. I understand that it's a small restaurant, but the waiters made us feel rushed. There's already a $15 per person minimum, and we ordered over that amount. We were brought the dessert menu while we were still eating, twice. Five minutes after signing the bill, we were politely asked by the waiter if we could leave our table. It could have been worse, but the service made the experience of eating here much less enjoyable.",3.0

2017,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant.

So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her.

So here's what we ordered for the night:
Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.

Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.

Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!

Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well.

Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol.

Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.

Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good.

Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah.",4.0
2017,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Berkeley. Given it's sorta biased since Japanese tapas is one of my favorite things to eat.

The food here is straight to the point and everything is freaking delicious. I've tried almost every item on their regular menu and I must say there are only a few misses. Their seasonal menus are always on point. 10/10.
No, the food isn't cheap, but for Japanese tapas, I would say it is very reasonably priced. Dinner for 2 with alcohol (and we ordered A LOT of stuff) is around $200.

Service is quick considering how crowded the restaurant always is. But because of high volumes of order, food can be a bit slow at times, but nothing a few sips of sake can't fix. The place makes me feel like I'm eating at a place in Japan (even though I have not been to Japan...YET)

Pro-tip: ALWAYS make reservations if you can. I've called the morning of and still get a reservation for later on that night. If you're not making a reservation, then plan to show up about 10-20 min before opening. The wait can be an hour, or even longer (if you have party larger than 2).",5.0

That is all.",2.0
2017,"Having been here a couple more times, here is a concise but more comprehensive review.

Reservations? Yes, make them if you can. I have yet to leave the restaurant spending less than $30pp (even not getting alcohol) so save yourself the inconvenience. If you still didn't make a reservation, your best bet is to get there between 5-5:20pm and put your name on the clip board for when they open at 5:30pm. Once, my party of 3 got there at 5:15 and we were one of the last parties to get onto the first seating. Another time, I got there around 7pm and waited roughly an hour.

What to order? Keep in mind many orders come with 1-2 servings.

=Order All the Time!=
- Yuba (Spoon of Uni, Soft Tofu, and Roe) ($12 for 2) - It was a taste of the ocean - rich and salty.
- Wagyu Tataki ($16) - It was only lightly seared but the thin slices and smokey flavor made it taste like the most tender and flavorful piece of steak.
- Sashimi Combo (Chef's Choice, $12 for 3 pieces, min 2 orders) - It's chef's choice but you can ask the server what is on the menu. There were about roughly 9 options with only one that I wouldn't eat so I thought it was worth the gamble. We got black snapper, tuna and stripe jack. All the pieces were delicious and delightful to eat.
- Fried Chicken Cartilege ($8) - Crunchy and tasty in a surprising way. It looks just like chicken kaarage but I thought it was much more enjoyable to eat.

=Order Again=
- Albacore Tataki ($12) - Lightly seared/grilled albacore dressed with a citrus vinaigrette. I love the acid and marinated onions. It paired perfectly with the fresh fish.
- Corn tempura with green tea salt ($5)- Freshly fried and deliciously sweet. The green tea salt is interesting although not really necessary. The batter although relatively light reminded me of fried fair food. Tasty!
- Osaka Style Taro Potato - Steamed mashed taro and potato formed into nice pillow-shaped statues topped with okonomoyaki sauce and bonito flakes. Although I expected something crispy it was pleasantly smooth and steamed. A great dense and filling dish.
- Grilled Beef Tongue - Tender, tasty, and didn't even taste like normal beef tongue. It was almost like a carefully braised and then grilled piece of pork belly!

=Wouldn't Order Again=
- Uni-Don - A small rice bowl topped with salmon sashimi, uni, and roe. Although this dish gets 'filling' points (don't want to be hungry after the meal) it was lackluster. The ingredients were fairly neutral but I didn't think the pairing with rice and seaweed was necessary.
- Buta-Kim - Pork with kimchi and poached egg. It tasted like a solid korean dish but maybe not something I would order again in a Japanese restaurant (unless you're going for high protein and something very filling). The pork was nicely cooked but the flavors weren't new or exciting.
- Grilled Rice Ball ($3) - It is what it is... My sister saw it on a TV show and wanted to try it but it probably wasn't worth the calories. Although if you're hungry and need a filler, this will do the job.

=Wish I didn't order=
- Grilled Whole Squid - Huge serving! The squid was nicely grilled but we felt with the skin still on and sort of an awkward (not fast or long) cook time it was bit tough and difficult to eat.
- Takowasabi - Raw octopus marinated in wasabi. I don't like wasabi (but tolerate it with good nigiri) so this was already a stretch to begin with. The octopus itself had a solid crunch with a tiny bit of slime. Not my favorite but I don't think it's a guaranteed crowdpleaser anyway.
- Spicy Tuna and Mountain Yam - The tuna was not noticeably spicy and I didn't care for the mushy texture alongside some micro-greens and the sliminess of the mountain yam. It was beautifully presented though in a bamboo bowl.
- Agedashi Taro and Potato - Again, this was a huge textural miss with the mashed taro and potato so lightly fried that it was near unnoticeable and overcome by the bland but thick agedashi sauce.",4.0

2016,"Kiraku is a nice restaurant. We were greeted with nice warm towels for our hands when we first sat down. However, it did take an hour and a half of waiting before we got seated, considering their policy requires a minimum of $30 per person for reservations and $15 per person for walk-ins and the venue is quite small with a long turnover rate.

As for the food, I wasn't really feeling the meat, so I ordered 3 small dishes: Agedashi tofu, Corn tempura (was super excited for this!), and the Butcher's Croquettes. Each was $5-6. The Agedashi tofu was very soft but the broth was too gooey and salty for my liking. The corn tempura was really good, but make sure you eat it while it's hot! The butcher's croquettes were surprisingly my favorite. The outside was nice and crispy and the inside was nice and tender with potatoes and beef and onion. Lots of times these kinds of dishes can get a little too rich and you can't finish, but these were perfect! I would come back for the corn tempura and butcher's croquettes!

2018,"Very Japanese in it's style. The food tasty, I do wish the portions were a bit more filling tho. They did leave me wanting more.

The tataki was very good, the squid was a bit chewy for my taste. The crockets were on point, the ramen broth was superb. The staff was friendly. but why do japanese restaurants have their staff yell when someone comes in? I have no idea.",4.0
2017,"This resto has been on my list forever and finally when hunnie decided to have Japanese tocelebrate his birthday, I immediately made reservations for this place.
If you plan to spend more than $40/pp, which you easily can, you can reserve a table. If not, be prepared to wait for 2 -3 hours.
The place is intimate and small but definitely has the good smell of Japanese cuisine.  
The hunnie and I got so excited when we saw the menu. We literally want to order everything. We had the chefs choice for sashimi, black cod, beef tongue,  grilled smelts and wagyu beef slices. Everything was super delish. Small portions but just enough for the two of us. Everything was well flavored and plated nicely. The tea as well was very good.  I mentioned too that it was his birthday, so they have you choose a dessert, then they turn off the lights and music in the resto and everyone and I mean everyone sings happy birthday !!!  
We will definitely come back here and order the HUGE hamachi Kama and fried corn. This might be my next favorite besides iyasare and Kokko.",5.0

Premium Beef tongue  
Yaki udon
Rock shrimp ten-don
Yuba
Suzuki Carpaccio
Sake Sampler

It's fresh produce and well balanced flavors.

2016,"Kiraku oh Kiraku.. there are few places I'd rather spend my paycheck on, and it's dangerous that Kiraku is a few mere steps away from where I work. Lines are long, staff is friendly but understandably busy, and food is quality over quantity.

Beef tongue skewer:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
Pork belly skewer:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
Both of these skewers were seasoned well and retained the coveted smokey flavor of charred embers, but they were both a tad chewy. I liked that the pork belly skewer wasn't overly fatty, but the chewiness of the fatty portions wasn't my favorite.

Uni and ikura atop silken tofu spoons:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
This is one of my favorite combinations of uni and ikura ever ever ever. The silken tofu is so incredibly fresh, and if you like silken tofu skins, you will not be disappointed with this version. The uni was sweet and decadent, while the ikura provided a nice salty contrast. I could eat these endlessly, but they do cost a pretty penny.

Grilled whole squid with teriyaki sauce:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
This jumbo squid was also nicely grilled with just the right amount of smokiness, and it was the perfect texture between tender and slightly elastic. It's one of the better preparations I've had, and of course it went well with the side of mayonnaise dipping sauce.

Corn tempura:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
When my friend told me about this corn tempura, I was doubtful that it would be anything special. But as far as fried corn goes, this is top of the list with just the right amount of crunchiness and burst-in-mouth sweetness of corn kernels. The green tea salt is a nice touch as well, although I think of it more as a novelty than a necessity.

Chicken cartilage:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
I had expected something a little different from this dish, but the thicker batter with little seasoning was surprisingly tasty with a spritz of lemon. I wouldn't get this unless you're in the mood to chew.. a lot, but it's a nice finger food to accompany beer or sake.

Beef tongue:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
Grilled to a beautiful medium rare, I liked this version of beef tongue better than the skewer version. The nice garlicky flavor permeated through each slice, but it wasn't so garlicky that it overwhelmed the freshness of the beef tongue.

Kimchi and pork with poached egg on top:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
This was one of my friend's favorites, but I was so stuffed by this time that I only had the bite. The flavoring was nice, especially the tartness of the kimchi, although the pork was a bit dry for my taste.

Sashimi sampler: salmon, bluefin tuna, toro:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
As with all of Kiraku's fare, this sashimi sampler was amazingly fresh and beautifully presented. The toro was buttery, the bluefin tuna was flavorful and a tad firmer, and the salmon was so fresh the fattiness was almost pearlescent. I enjoyed the shiso immensely as well, especially in between different varieties of fish.

Spicy cod roe, tako wasabi, jellyfish:
(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)
This was more of an appetizer dish, and I had mixed feelings about the combination. My favorite was the spicy cod roe, which was slightly seared and embodied a nice mealy texture. It's not for everyone, but I personally love roe of all kinds, so it was right down my alley. The tako wasabi is definitely an acquired taste, as it's raw octopus mixed with wasabi. It was flavorful, but the texture was rather slimey. The jellyfish was nothing too different from the Chinese version, but it veered towards the sweet side and had a nice crunch to it.

I adore Kiraku to no small degree, and I definitely think that the quality is worth the asking price. I'll certainly be back.",4.0
2018,This is a favorite of ours. The very first time we went it was a Saturday without reservations during the winter. We waited 2 hours! Outside in the cold! I was very Hangry but the wait was so worth the food that awaits you inside. Small restaurant that gives you that intimate close friends and family vibe. Great regional Japanese foods and the alcohol selection to back it up. Don't go here and get the sushi or teriyaki chicken or whatever boring notion you have of Japanese food. That's not what this place is about. It's about new and interesting ways to elevate traditional Japanese dishes that may not be so obvious to try but once you do you'll be hooked. Get reservations. It will be a 2 hour wait if you don't. If you wing it without reservations its still worth it. Go with an appetite. Try everything. Leave happy.,5.0
2017,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  

We ordered:
Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.

Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.

Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.

Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful.

Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.

Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.

Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.

The server was super friendly and all of the food was super fresh. You can definitely see the authenticity as soon as you walk in the restaurant.

A lot of people get the corn tempura, that was pretty good too. There are a lot of small plates here so try to order a variety to taste them all. The only dish that was below average was the Chazuke which is a bowl of rice with soup covering it and a small piece of salmon on top. Don't order that one!

It's very hard to get a table here because 1) they don't take reservations for groups less than 5 and 2) the restaurant space is pretty small.  However, everything was incredibly delicious, and worth repeat visits.  It's my first time eating Japanese tapas, and I'm already sold.

Kiraku salad: good balance of vegetables and flavors; it was a bit larger than I anticipated, and could be shared between two people.
Salmon chazuke: there are three components that come with this: the long plate with a variety of toppings (slivers of fish, furikake/seasoning, salted vegetables), a bowl with a mound of rice at the center, and a teapot full of dashi.  The number of topping combinations meant that each bite had a different and amazing flavor, and combined with rice and dashi made for an amazing taste.  
Together the total was about $15, which was not as pricey as I anticipated.  The waiters were great, and moved groups around very efficiently.

We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon.

I have come here multiple times, from 2 people to a group of 14, this place just never disappoint. Almost every item is good for sharing. Might be on a pricy side (depends on how much/ what you order), but it's definitely worth every penny.
If you are visiting for the first time, I would recommend the takowasa (octopus with wasabi) for appetizer. Main dishes: corn tempura, sashimi salad, yuba spoons (ikura, uni and tofu), buta-kim (sliced pork belly with kimchi and poached egg on top), yaki udon (udon with a special pesto sauce), black cod and beef tongue with black truffle oil. It is great to end a meal with their homemade grapefruit yogurt, since it's very refreshing. Their cheesecake cubes and roasted tea blanc manger are also great desserts!

Tips: This place is pretty small so you should make a reservation. If you didn't make a reservation, you should come 15-30minutes before it opens to secure a seat.

After finishing one of my final's fairly early, me and the BF decided to go to Berkeley for dinner, knowing we could arrive at Kiraku right when they opened and not have to wait. However, we were verryy early so decided to grab drinks at Triple Rock and wait till 5:30. Our mistake, we ended up getting full off the beer.

We ordered:
Yuba
Jumbo Squid
Daily special of scallop and toro sashimi
Foie Gras Daikon
Mini donburi

The Yuba spoons were good. I mean tofu skin, ikura, and uni?! You can't really go wrong there. The flavors were light and went well together. The jumbo squid was super tender! The scallop and toro sashimi were fresh and delicate. I did wish the toro was fattier. The foie gras daikon was a disappointment. Its an interesting concept, and I enjoyed the flavors of the sauce with the daikon, but felt there was too little foie gras for the price. The mini donburi was very mini (but about the price of regular donburi) and it was just okay. Pretty though!

Service was standard and the food came out fairly quick.

I wouldn't worry about the price minimum ($15 per person for walk in and $30 per person for reservations). You'll definitely hit it. The price for these 5 small dishes were $85 before tax and tip. I couldn't imagine if we came here starving!",3.0
2017,"The sea bass carpaccio was delicious..

Surprisingly the octopus was not bad, it's slimy and looks gross, but has a good wasabi taste..

The grilled squid was pretty good.

The corn was so so, wasn't a huge fan.

Salmon sashimi was soft and melts in your mouth.

The mini kensai bowl was so tiny, cute, but wasn't a huge fan.

Mackerel was fishy smelling, but it did have a good sear on it.

Fried chicken was not bad, too much oil though.

Ordered a ton of food, and all weren't bad.  

Beef tongue and pork belly was too chewy, so didn't like it.

Broccolini with snow crab, was ok, the taste of the snow crab was too fishy.

Oyako tasted like chinese ginger chicken.

The takowasabi (octopus in wasabi) is great if you LOVE wasabi. I was personally not a big fan. But the octopus was fresh and my friend greatly enjoyed the wasabi flavor.

The pork belly skewer was a little disappointing, but it's pork belly and what can you expect. So wouldn't recommend it because I don't think it's worth it, but if you're a fan, it's not bad!

I AM IN LOVE WITH THE GREEN TEA SALT CORN TEMPURA. I get it every time I'm here. It's so good. Just do it, no regrets at all!

Agedashi tofu is also one of my favorites!!! The soup is nice and flavorful, but not too much and the tofu is so soft with a nice tempura on the outside.

The broccolini with rock crab dish, must be seasonal, but it was a tad disappointing. Not a lot of crab and too much broccolini (which I love) but not when I'm paying lots of money for it.

Albacore tataki was also pretty good. I'm not a huge not-fully-cooked fish person, but I still really enjoyed it. Great flavors all mixed together with a light sauce and fresh albacore made it delicious.",4.0

It's a small restaurant, and you either have to make a reservation or wait.

I started calling on a Tuesday, and was able to confirm a Friday 5:45pm reservation, with a mimimum order amount of $40.  Parking takes time as well since you are doing street parking in Berkeley - so just bring patience if you need to park and wait for a table.

We ordered:
Sake sampler
Appetizer sampler - my husband picked some type of picked vegetable (cucumber?), and octopus dish and I think a third octopus dish (I don't eat octopus but he finished it off so i assumed it was delicious)
Sashimi 7 piece special - very fresh, my husband loved the baby squid and the slices of  squid rolled up with some type of leaf.  The salmon sashimi was excellent.
Yuba spoons - really good combo of uni and roe
House-made tofu - I'll order this again!  I personally loved it - simple flavors but very good.  The house-made tofu was served with sides of chopped green onions, salt and sesame seeds
Corn Tempura - simple, unique and very good, I will also order this again
Agedashi tofu - my staple, I love Agedashi tofu.  The tofu was good and friend well, although I found the sauce it be oddly thick (but it tasted good)
Pork belly yakitori - very, very good grilled flavor.  If you're into pork belly, you better order this
Grapefruit sorbet - Both this and the green tea ice cream came in much larger scoops than we anticpated - my husband really liked the flavor of this, and it was marked as house-made
Green tea ice cream with mochi, red bean and cream - always yummy, and the mochi was very soft and fresh

We ordered: uni and ikura spoons, takowasabi, corn tempura, kiraku salad, buta kim, roasted duck, saba shio, wrapped salmon,  and three skewers: beef tongue, pork belly, and beef sirloin.

I definitely recommend the uni and ikura spoons, wrapped salmon, and roasted duck. These dishes had their own unique flavors and I would definitely get them again. The takowasabi was interesting as well. It's basically raw octopus mixed with wasabi, but it was a bit overwhelming for me. In my opinion, each piece had a lot of wasabi so it was good that it came with really small pieces of tako to prevent myself from tearing up or crying. I would pass on the buta kim. The dish is made up of kimchee, an egg, and bits of pork. While looking at the dish, you can barely see the pork let alone taste it. Unless you LOVE kimchee, skip it.

2017,"Fantastic fine on our recent SF/Napa trip. We stayed in Emeryville. It was a Friday night and we were looking for a nice sushi place for a late dinner. This place had great reviews and was only 10-15 mins from our hotel. After reading all the reviews we know it's a small place so we were expecting a long wait. We arrived just after 9pm. Signed our name on the clipboard. There was only 1 party ahead of us. Total wait time was about 15 mins.

We have places very similar to this back home in Las Vegas so we knew what to expect. It's Japanese tapas so it's small plates meant for sharing and trying many different dishes. 3-4 dishes per person.

Husband and I got 2 carafes of Sake, 7 pieces sashimi sampler, uni & salmon roe on spoons (forgot the name), roasted duck breast (only dish we didn't care for), pork Belly skewer, beef tongue skewer, beef tataki, Waygu beef w/ foe grais, waygu beef w/ uni, Uni on crispy rice w/ teriyaki sauce. Our total bill came out to $167 before tip.

Everything was amazing with the exception of the duck. Everything bite was fresh, delicious and full flavor. All in all it was a great dining experience. So glad we found this little gem. Thank you yelp!

Recap...
It's small, it's loud, it's busy, the service and food was to die for. Must try!",5.0
2016,"Finding this Japanese restaurant is not going to be difficult. Just look for one that has people on the outside waiting and you'll find exactly where it is. There are two Japanese restaurants located on the same block where Kiraku will be. On busy nights just like the one where I went, parking may be a little difficult. So plan ahead. It may also be wise to make reservations. It took me and my friend an hour wait just to get seated and may I say it was all worth it.

Kiraku, just like most of izakaya restaurants in the south bay area which I am more familiar with, is a small Japanese restaurant packed with even smaller tables inside just like how it is where this native style of food serving comes from. It smells like different kinds of grilled, roasted, and braised meat plus soups and awesome goodies with nori inside. You know right away that when you're done eating, you'll  smell exactly like what you ate.

It is nothing different inside than any other Izakaya restaurant. However, the food and service deserve nothing less than five stars. It would be very unfair to give them any less. Order any sake and they present you with a selection of your own sake cups! I find it very personal and unique. Come and celebrate somebody's birthday here and surprise them, the lights turn off and all of a sudden everybody sings Happy Birthday. Since the place is very enclosed and not very big, all of a sudden everybody is your family and you are being celebrated!

Now onwards to the food. I figured that instead of the grilled Angus beef, I would try to order the premium braised Beef tongue with truffle oil and roasted salt. Ordered the salmon carpaccio, dried fish (not the unagi), ceviche, roasted duck Kiraku style, Kiraku salad, plum chazuke, edamame, pork belly skewers, pork intestine skewers ... the food was arriving endlessly and they didn't disappoint. Salted just right and the meats appear really tender. The ham from the Kiraku salad was tasty and delectable.

When in Berkeley and if a fan of izakaya, Kiraku would be THE place to go. I definitely heard one of the groups waiting outside say, ""This is now our favorite Japanese restaurant!"" to one of their companions. I don't blame them a bit.

Despite of this vagrant that kept hassling each group waiting outside then started smoking and blowing smoke as if it was pineapple-flavored hookah, the wait was definitely worth it.

The atmosphere inside is noisy, as the tables are very close to each, other but it wasn't loud enough that I was able to notice the nice jazz music that played. Ah...

Close your eyes and savor every dish. My favorite during my visit here was the dried fish. They have moist towels for you to clean your hands with before dining so feel free to eat with your hands !

2015,"Short Story:  A good place for Japanese Tapas!
Long Story:  I came here on a Saturday evening for Japanese Tapas.  The place is really small and even though we got a reservation at 7PM we waited until about 7:30pm to be seated.  The menu is somewhat extensive with lots of things to try and eat.  Feel free to order lots because it'll take a lot to get you full.

The good thing is that for the most part the food does not take that much time before it comes out.  We ordered lots of diferent types of food...see the pictures for details.  Although what I will say is that this place like most other tapas places can be pricey...be ready to spend three digits with 2 or more people!

Verdict:  Saving up more money for next time...!",4.0
2017,"What an amazing experience! Kiraku was a serendipitous find for us when we stayed in Berkeley trying find a decent dinner spot. Coming here we had no idea how high demand and popular the seats are here. The place opens at 530 pm but there was a crowd of people waiting 30 mins in advance with most of the locals knowing to have reservations. We did not make reservations... but we were lucky enough to make the cut. By that I mean that this place , once its seated at capacity of about 50 people it will close its doors until 7 pm for all those inside to comfortably order and eat.

Now we made it in just on time for the waiting list. those who missed the wait had to wait 1-1 and 1/2 hour to be seated for the next dinner round. But just having had the experience here I highly recommend waiting.

Kiraku is an izakaya styled restaurant or you can say a japanese tapas bar. You come in and they give you a 2 paged menu of what is offered as well as a selection of the specials for that evening. Each dish can run from 4-15 dollars and they are all uniquely delicious. There is also a sake menu.

The options are plentiful and you really should just go to town on the menu, ask for recommendations and go for things that sound appealing. you can easily get lost ordering 5-10 things here. Some of the most memorable dishes were the corn tempura, wagyu beef, grilled squid, black cod, tuna cheeks, and the udon. All were just delicious.

If you're in berkeley or just visiting you definitely need to come to kiraku.",5.0
2017,"Make sure to get there around 5:30 or you'll end up waiting a long time for a table. My bf and I got these dishes and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us:

* seaweed
* pork belly skewer: a bit oily but super good!
* shrimp ten don: the shrimp was soggy not crispy but everything else was pretty yummy
* corn tempura: I really liked this dish!
* agedashi tofu: really yummy!
* omelet salad
* green tea ice cream: the ice cream is very creamy and comes with a green tea mochi and a red bean thingy that I'm not a huge fan of.",5.0
2018,"Excellent food and service. I've been there twice and both times have been superlative. The sake selection is extensive and service steers you in the right direction with both food and drink. The pickles are delightful, the spiced jellyfish was an unexpected thrill in taste and texture, and I loved the seared spicy cod roe. The chef sashimi platter was a large platter of pristine, jewel-tone fish. The black cod was among the best I've had recently. I wanted to turn my nose up at the corn tempura but instead we ordered it twice...We finished our feast with a simple and comforting ramen dish. Then in a moment of gluttony we ordered the mini kaisen donburi instead of dessert. Then we ordered the sweet potato brûlee as second dessert- great texture, less-sweet variation on the usual crême.

Waddled home in a happy stupor.

Definitely worth reserving, as there were lines out the door. Reservations require $40/person minimum which includes drink.

PS In case you're wondering how this compares to Ippukku, for me Ippuku offers a more sensuous space but I'd give Kiraku the edge when it comes to the food.",5.0
2017,"Seriously the best restaurant meal I've ever had in my life. Beef tongue skewers, steamed snapper head, tsumami starters (takowasabi!!!), were HEAVENLY.

The reservation via phone was not so responsive (they called me back the next day) but it was well worth it. Service was brisk and efficient.",5.0
2018,This place does not follow their waitlist fairly. People who had barely arrived kept getting seated in front of us for no apparent reason (they did not have reservations). Do not come here if you want to wait almost 3 hours. We left after 2 hours and 40 minutes of waiting and watching people shamelessly cut the people on the waitlist.,1.0
2017,"This is a MUST TRY! I've been here several times on different occasions within the years and they never disappoint! So far my favorites are the Canadian Black Pork Kukuni (something along the name of that) and their Foie Gras on the daily menu with grilled rice and mushrooms. They have a staple menu but I highly suggest exploring their changing daily menu!

The place may have a long wait but it's worth it. Last time I went we has reservations which made it even better! Please keep in mind there's a minimum for reservations but it's very easy to get to that limit!

2017,"Easily a 5 star--the best Japanese restaurant in the Bay Area. My friends and I had to wait for an hour and a half to eat here, but it was definitely well worth it.

PROS
* amazing selection
* every dish tasted fresh and delicious
* every dish that they brought out had their own unique taste and identity to it. When you eat it together, the tastes compliments each other
* I personally don't like eating raw fish, but their salmon sashimi was extremely appetizing
* staff was very friendly. You don't feel forgotten even if the restaurant is busy
* one of the best experiences we've had in a Japanese cuisine
* highly recommend if you aren't afraid to spend money on high quality Japanese tapas

2017,"Tucked away on Telegraph, it's hard to miss Kiraku because there is always a large group of people waiting outside! The inside is tiiiiiny - so the tiny tables are super close together to seat people.

Service is great - because they're trying to get you out quickly, they are super responsive and helpful. Food comes out fairly quickly.

The yummms:
-Grapefruit yogurt ice cream (10/5): that's right - save some space because you will want to be eating this light, tart, amazing ice cream.
-Corn Tempura (5/5): what?! it's a hunk of kernels of corn, fried, topped with a mysterious green tea salt.. it's amazing.
-Oyakodon (5/5): my absolute FAVORITE. Smooth egg, juicy chicken, perfect rice.... mmmm.
-Fried garlic (4/5): super good, these are literally cloves of garlic fried. The miso sauce on the side is pretty good.
-Black pork belly skewer (4/5): also amazing, well cooked, and flavorful
-Yuzu udon (2/5): not my favorite broth, it has a weird window cleaner after taste because of the yuzu citrus",4.0

2017,"The wait here is insane. I got here at 5:30pm on a Sunday when they opened but was already late for putting my name down as there was already a line. We didn't get seated until 7:45. We were also asked if we could finish in 30 minutes because there were still a tremendous amount of people waiting. I noticed one guy got guaranteed seating even though he wrote his name down pretty late after us just because he was one of those demanding snobby customers with an attitude, so they put him ahead of people for the time he was promised. But anyways, the food here was pretty good. We got the salmon carpaccio, 5 kinds sashimi of the day, roasted angus beef tongue, mini donburi, wagyu beef tataki, and Wagyu nigiri with uni. I enjoyed everything we got except for the roast beef tongue, was kind of salty, had no other kind of flavor to me and I just didn't like the texture of tongue in general. The salmon carpaccio was amazing and was probably my favorite for the night. The sashimi was super fresh and unique, I tried fish I've never had before like red snapper, etc. The donburi was nice, you could taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Overall, this dinner flavor wise was top notch, but for the value and worth I'd wouldn't come again unless it's for a very special occasion. Next time I would also get a reservation. Don't even worry about their $100 minimum or whatever you're gonna hit it trust me. I really enjoyed the coziness of this little restaurant though, and plus we managed to finish within 30 minutes like they asked. Our bill came out to be around $120 for two people which is pretty pricy for me. If you're considering trying this place, I would also consider looking into gochi Asian fusion tapas in cupertino because that's where I'll be headed to for my next tapas place! Peace.",4.0
2017,"Definitely on the pricey side but worth it! It's one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Berkeley. I've been here several times and my favorite items to order are the tempura corn (served in 2 peices), roasted duck kiraku style, the sashimi, and the jumbo squid. I've tried the ramen as well as the Yuzu Udon but I wasn't super impressed by it. It was a little bit plain and the flavor was alright. For drinks, I recommend the Capico Chuhai, fuji apple sake and the Oolong Chuhai. The service was great and the waitress always came by to ask if we needed anything. Overall a great experience, but be prepared to wait at least an hour or so on a Friday night. If you are really committed to coming here, I suggest making a reservation beforehand to skip the line. I wish I had known this before waiting!",5.0
2015,"Exotic food in an unexpected location.

Who would think that in the middle of run of the mill Telegraph Avenue would be a food-lovers mecca? Kiraku has an amazing selection of Japanese style tapas and flights of sake. From corn fritters to grilled octopus. The selection is amazingly diverse. The prices are reasonable. There is no point in writing a long essay about the amazing fare. Visit Kiraku and see yourself.

The wait can get long, so get their just before dinner time for prime seating. There is a sign-up sheet at the door. Reservations are available and advisable if you plan on the full izakaya experience.",5.0
2015,"This place is so good!! Almost wanted to give it 5 stars. The food is pretty bomb and amazing, and I haven't even tried the sashimi yet.

Top 3:
1. WAGYU BEEF - 5 stars. One of the favorites. Fresh raw beef...may be a bit scary, but tasted so good. Amazing
2. FOIE GRAS w/ DAIKON - 5 stars. Prob my favorite!! Love love love foie gras, and the sauce that came with it complemented it very well
3. BAKED SCALLOPS - 4.5 stars. Only giving it 4.5 stars because I think 5 is when scallops are fresh and perfectly pan seared, but this dish baked with pistacio toppings was no doubt extremely good.

Pretty good:
4. CORN TEMPURA - 4 stars. Very interesting! Crunchy corn with tempura batter.  Must get
5. BUTA KIM - 3.5 stars. More like a korean dish than japanese. Wish there were more pork
6. PORK BELLY SKEWER - 4 stars. Can't go wrong with pork belly
7. GREEN APPLE SAKE - 4 stars. Sweet and flavorful! Very light in alcohol though, but a delicious drink nonetheless

Good/ok:
7. YAKI DON - 3 stars. The bonito flakes were moving!!! I was amazed haha. This dish was kind of like stir-fried udon with sauce. It was good, though compared to the other dishes, wasn't a highlight (other than the bonito flakes moving of course).

NOTE: For reservations, they require you to have $30 worth of food each person plus 1 drink. It can easily be done though since they're small plates that add up.

OVERALL: I'd definitely come back again! With all of that it came out to be around $50+ each person. Worth it though!",4.0

2015,"Kiraku, kicks, ass, man!
The lady and I spared no expense in trying everything that we could... We were left wanting to try so much more, but our bellies were surely at 120% capacity.

Pro's:
- Food is stellar
- Very fresh cuts of meat and fish (beef tongue, tuna & salmon...)
- You get what you pay for
- Diverse array of choices

Con's:
- Can be a very long wait if you walk up at the wrong time; call in to reserve (you'll be so thankful you did, rather than being next in line and have four parties show up right in time to get seated before you).
- Service can be choppy, but they are very friendly and helpful with suggestions.

2016,"TLDR: High end restaurant that is absolutely worth everything you pay. Make sure to try the sake sampler.

Came here with the BF for a date night. I had mixed hopes for this place because I love Japanese food but I hate tapas places. I've gotten pretty cynical about tapas lately because all of the ones I've tried have been nothing more than average food with high price tags.

Luckily, we got there ten minutes or so before it opened because we wanted to make it to a 7pm movie showing. There was already someone waiting when we got there, and by the time the place opened at 5:30, there were 4+ groups waiting. There was limited table space inside, but we were able to get a seat with the first batch of customers. So far, it seemed pretty promising.

We decided to order a sake sampler, a few appetizers and a ramen to share.
Sake Sampler: Don't remember the exact name, I just know that I picked the one that had Sakura in the title. The sake was amazing, it had a floral taste to it that blended really well with the rest of the sake flavors. I'm usually to cheap to get alcohol with my meal but I'm definitely going to get another sampler next time I come here.

Mackerel: Really really good. I hear the mackerel can be really hit or miss, but I've been lucky because the few that I've tried have all been pretty good. This dish was no exception, the fish was amazingly fresh and didn't have overwhelming fishy taste that most mackerel have. The presentation was also amazing, the fish was cut into thin pockets and they gave you finely cut ginger, scallions, and wasabi that you could stuff into the fish pockets. The overall flavor was awesome and provided an interactive way to eat your food without being gimmicky.

Eggplant: Very whatever, not bad but not great. I think this was the most generically ""Tapas"" dish we tried there, probably won't waste stomach space on it next time.

Pork Belly: I didn't eat this but one ($3?) skewer was enough for two people to taste. Since it was so cheap, we thought it would be just one or two small cubes of meat, but the skewer actually came with four sizable strips. They have quite a few different meat skewers all around the same price, so you could order one of each and have enough for four people to sample.

Ramen: We ordered this mostly to fill up and it did what it needed to. The dish was cheap and filling. The noodles themselves were really springy which we loved, but the broth was a little plain. We might try a different entree next time, but it's a good dish to order if you want to fill up a little without spending a lot on just appetizers.

Overall, the food was really good and the pricing matched. I loved that you get exactly what you pay for here. You don't leave feeling like you got scammed paying a premium for pretty looking food that doesn't really taste all that great.

P.S.: This might be weird, but I thought their bathroom was really cool. Check it out between sake shots.",5.0
2015,"I've had to pleasure to eat here a couple times despite its price range. I'm a college student after all! Most of the clientele are people who are already working full time, so you don't see many students.

Corn tempura

2017,"Originally, this review would have been 5 stars, but the bathroom wasn't very nice and taken care of. And when i say very, I mean VERY.

Pros: Service is pretty good (considering that there wasn't a huge amount of staff and the restaurant was pretty small. They gave us hot towels to clean our hands, which was pretty cool. The food was really really good, like it belongs in a 5 star hotel. The decor was nice. They presented the food very nicely. They even put the tempura in a little basket! Adorable (* '.' *)

Cons: Sometimes the service was a little slow, but the quality of the food  makes up for it. The food itself was pretty small and expensive for size, but for quality ok I guess. Like one skewer was $6. And it wasn't very big. Also, the wait. It took more than a hour for a 3 person party. The restaurant is pretty small, so I understand, but still....

Came out of the restaurant still pretty hungry because we didn't want to spend anymore money. Get the giant squid beef tongue and pork belly skewers. Giant squid is probably the biggest dish you can order. Corn tempura is also interesting but in the end it's just corn. Curry fried fish was too salty for me but my brother said he enjoyed it. Chicken karage also really good. Big chunks of meaty chicken. Skip the duck and pesto udon. Pesto udon was interesting to try but again salty and way too heavy tasting. Service is REALLY attentive...they kicked us out right after we paid to allow other guests to be seated. LOL.

2016,"Looks like Kiraku is making a noble effort to emulate the authenticity of a Japanese izakaya. In Japan, an izakaya is a drinking pub and tapas style food is served to complement the libations. In the US, izakayas are better known for their food, as it is common to see families with young children partaking in the experience. Drinking has taken a backseat and understandably so with our strict DUI laws. Back to Kiraku! They require you to spend at least $30 (per person) on food and alcoholic beverages whenever you make a reservation. We did have a reservation and when we requested only tea and water to drink, the server literally coerced us into ordering drinks even if they were non-alcoholic! I wasn't too sure this was a genuine effort on their part to promote the concept of izakaya or it looked like an underhanded way to guarantee a minimum $ amount from those who have reservations!

Anyway, we weren't too upset as the food more than compensated for any ruffled feathers.  We were each given an oshibori (warm towel) as we sat and that is becoming a rarity. We kicked off the evening with sashimi. Sashimi is usually a good opening act to any izakaya meal. Its delicacy would be upstaged by the savoriness of dishes that followed. The server claimed that their sashimi was the best in the Bay Area although I found that hard to swallow! In less than 5 minutes....Tadaaa! 10 beautifully sliced and elegantly presented fish ($32 chef's choice) were placed in front of our eyes! The fish were more than a step up from the conventional maguro, hamachi and shake. There were 2 slices each of shima aji (striped horse mackerel), hon maguro (bluefin tuna), kurodai (black sea bream), kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and Hokkaido scallops. We savored the pristine freshness and natural sweetness of each fish. Were they the best? They were excellent no doubt but I wasn't convinced they were the absolute best. (5/5)

Some of the memorable highlights of the evening included:

1. Corn Tempura or Kakiage ($5) was crunchy, addicting and of course using our good ol' American corn! The corn kernels were clustered in a batter and deep-fried. The green tea salt sprinkled on top would allow the delicate aroma to come through leaving a subtle saltiness and sweetness in my tongue. Savor the thick but light cake flour tempura. Get this! (4/5)
2. Grilled Black Cod in Sake Lees or Gindara Saikyo-yaki ($15) is an all time izakaya classic and also a favorite of mine. The black cod was well marinated with the right amount of miso and sake to produce a wonderful juxtaposition of umami. With masterful grilling, the buttery fish and its melt-in-your-mouth quality further accentuated the taste. Chances are the black cod were from off the Alaskan waters. (4/5)
3. Ayu shioyaki, a Japanese river trout or sweetfish grilled in salt, is prized for its distinctive, sweet flavor. The skin was crispy and the flesh was delicate, juicy and firm but not mushy. To a Japanese, the innards were the real delicacy with a slightly bitter taste. Don't even hesitate to grab this fish, as they're seasonal and rarely available. (5/5)
4. Uni and Ikura atop yuba (tofu skin) spoons ($12) provided an interesting contrast between saltiness (from the ikura, the salmon roe) and sweetness (from the uni) all in one mouthful. The silken yuba like uni was velvety but bland in a good way. As far as I was concerned, this was a fitting dessert and a decadent one too! (4/5)

Yakitori was a noticeable omission in Kiraku's menu that was OK by me as I am not a huge yakitori fan. It is certainly one of the better izakayas that had sprouted all over the Bay Area in recent years. Servers were all Japanese that spoke perfect English, knowledgeable in Japanese cuisine and most of all attentive, friendly and helpful. Décor was not much to talk about but the vibe, the servers and food transported me to a make believe izakaya experience in Japan.

2016,"Before I start this review I should point out that I'm not into raw seafood, it wasn't until 3 months ago that I was finally able to eat a whole piece of salmon sashimi.

This restaurant is tiny, so as a group of 7 we knew we had to wait for a table. What we didn't know is we would have to wait 2.5 hours!! The lady that worked the seating kept letting groups of 4 pass us instead of just connecting two tables and adding an extra chair. So frustrating! 30 minutes before FINALLY sitting down the lady came out and took our orders. The group ordered a tower of asahi and that was ready before we were. They should start thinking of expanding to a bigger location.

When we finally sat down, they gave us a grilled jumbo squid on the house for the long wait. That was a nice gesture. I grew the courage to try a piece. This was the first time having squid with still an outer layer of skin, it was squishy with a bit of toughness but had such great flavor! And then one by one our orders started appearing. My boyfriend and I had ordered the corn tempura, rock shrimp ten don, bluefin tuna cheek meat steak, and sashimi 5 piece (minimum two order).
-corn tempura was too oily
-rock shrimp ten don was average
-bluefin tuna cheek was DELICIOUS, if I could I would eat that all the time!!! Literally melts in your mouth
-boyfriend says sashimi was very fresh

From the other plates that the group ordered I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken karaage! They also ordered (4 orders to be exact) of the beef intestine skewer. The smell itself was phenomenal but I had no desire in eating intestines. That is definitely a must try for anyone who doesn't mind eating intestines lol.

I do not appreciate the restaurant having a minimum spending limit per person, what if I want to come for lunch and only order ramen? Ugh.

For a group of 7 the bill came out to $310.

2015,"I came here over the summer on a weekday evening - it was still packed with people and we still had to wait 30 minutes for seats for a party of 2 (clearly, they are very popular!). They are an izakaya so they serve small snack-like dishes rather than meal sets for dinner (usually alongside some form of alcohol). It's a very very small store front, so large groups will likely need to wait for a while (and you'll be seated very closely to other patrons). Also, because most people are slightly inebriated, it gets quite loud in there.

If you don't frequent izakayas, feel free to ask the waiters/waitresses for recommendations - they're quite friendly and happy to suggest dishes to you (especially if there are any seasonal specials). We ended up ordering a bunch of dishes to share including: salmon sashimi, wagyu beef tataki, osaka style taro potato, maze gohan, and yuzu mochi.

Sashimi was very fresh - definitely recommend (but cost $14 for 6 pieces)! Wagyu was also super tender and basically dissolved in your mouth. The taro potato was interesting, but not my favorite - a bit too starchy for my tastes. Maze gohan was salmon pieces with ikura (salmon roe) mixed into the rice. This was more like a meal-style dish and was a solid dish. We finished off with yuzu mochi which was soft, tart and delicious!

I definitely recommend this place, but make a reservation if you can because the wait is a bit unbearable considering they don't even have room for you to stand inside while you wait. The food is very fresh, unique and of a great quality, but sometimes a bit on the pricier side.",4.0
2017,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult.

The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.
+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!
+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness.
+CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!
+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.
+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.
+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.
+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.
+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!

The ingredients used in this restaurant are extremely high quality and are used harmoniously in all the dishes.

Today, I ordered a squid dish off the special menu that was absolutely delicious and novel to me. The squid and its ink were very hearty, and the fresh cilantro was a great addition to the dish. The sashimi was amazing as per usual, and the cucumbers to the moro q were perfectly crispy. They've started to offer beers from Coedo brewery that have banana/clove accents, which paired well with all the different dishes we ordered. The roasted tea blanc-manger is a must try if you like tea flavors in your desserts.

We pored over the menu and decided on a number of items:

Pros:
-We started off with two spoons of YUBA, ROE, and UNI. I forgot the exact name of the dish, but it was on Kiraku's special seasonal menu. My friend and I both knocked it back in one go, and exchanged the same astounded look. I personally don't like raw seafood very much, but the combination of buttery uni, refreshing roe, and sweet yuba was enough to make me happy
-We asked our waitress for a recommendation from the grilled menu, and she promptly pointed us to the GRILLED COD plate. The cod was soft and tender, and it came with a tasty sweet soy-like sauce
-My favorite dish of the night was the SLOW COOKED KAKUNI PORK. I'm not sure if that was the exact name of the dish, but just ask for Kakuni pork, if anything. Four large slabs of tender pork were bathed in a mixture of oil and sauce and topped off with a perfectly soft-boiled egg. I'm not even sure how to describe the pork in words - it was so good that I laughed for a good 5 minutes after my first bite
-I revisited an old favorite of mine, the ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA, and it was as good as I remember. Battered, drenched in Japanese mayo, and topped off with green scallion, the shrimp was the perfect combination of sweet, savory, and crunchy
-We concluded our meal with the YUZU MOCHI dessert. The mochi itself was flavored with yuzu, a hybrid of lemon and orange, and stuffed with a sweet, creamy coconut filling. A delicious ending to a great dinner!

Cons:
-The SEA BASS CARPACCIO, also from the special menu, was very subpar. The bass was a bit too fishy, and I think I only enjoyed the dish because it was drenched in sesame oil and scallion",5.0
2018,"I would have given five if I went there just once. I went again after a week and the honeymoon was already over. surprisingly after couple of orders, I ran out of things to get. My favorites were 1)beef tartare 2)grilled tuna jaw 3) grilled squid. All the skewers were decent and sashimi was just ok. My least favorite was fried garlic.",4.0

2018,One of our go to Japanese restaurants that we enjoy when we have a small celebration. Fresher fish than most places in the east bay.,4.0
2015,"4.5 stars and 430 reviews on yelp? How could this be?

And yet, it really was that good! The place is tiny, with barely any room to walk to your table. There aren't a lot of tables inside, and of course all the tables are very small, and as expected there is a wait outside, and the wait is loooonnng (2 hours).

But alas, it's all worth it. The price is a bit steep, and the portions are small, but taste excellent! The grilled squid had a smokey flavor, with a very interesting / refreshing dipping sauce. I've never tried ""corn tempura"" anywhere else before, and never knew it could taste so good! Crunchy, juicy, and yet not oily.

The buta kim was ok. The foie gras diakon was insanely good! The richness of the foie gra really complements the cleansing neutrality of the daikon underneath. The salmon roe, coupled with the uni, was extremely good--if you leave the entire spoon of goodness in your mouth for a while, before biting down, you can taste the different flavors of goodness in the mix. The mochi at the end was also excellent--soft, not too cold, and melts in your mouth.

The decor inside is not flashy, but has a home-y vibe. The wait staff are also all very friendly.

Overall, a worth the 2hr wait!",5.0
2016,"I can't emphasize how much I am in love with this place. Just be prepared that without reservations, you might ended up waiting ~2 hours before you get seated since it is a pretty cozy Izakaya. Service always incredibly good. Food never fails me. I am a all time Japanese food addict and I am telling you all that this place is a MUST.

I ordered this peach sake this time and it is really delicious. Food wise, I would never miss out their Yuba and Beef Tongue (either Skewer or Seared). I have almost tried all of the dishes on the menu and just can't tell you what not to order. Everything has been beyond expectations. Just enjoy!",5.0
2017,"One of my favorites! Always get some from the specials--so fresh. They're wagyu beef tataki is the best I've ever had (and I've lived in Asia a long time). Wrap some of the onions, ginger and ground radish and let your mouth experience the wonderfulness! Their suzuki sashimi? Or tataki was great too. So refreshing and flavorful! Corn tempura a must as usual.",5.0
2015,"I think if I were more adventurous Kiraku would be a 5 star restaurant. But i'm not haha. I ordered the beef tongue skewers, the pork belly skewers, black snapper sashimi, corn tempura, chicken karaage, jumbo squid, and hokkaido scallops.

The chicken karaage was extremely underwhelming. I'm not a fan of being able to taste pieces of fat in my fried chicken, so I really did not enjoy this dish. However, it was fried really well, and the lemon they included was a nice addition. I also though the pork belly skewers were surprisingly dry (considering how much fat pork belly was). I'm not sure if this is just a one off, but I'm pretty sure they were overcooked.

The jumbo squid was my second favorite. It comes with this yummy mayo, and the squid is cooked perfectly. The tentacles were extra delicious because the teriyaki seasoning coated all sides. Whereas the body of the squid needed the mayo. While I didn't enjoy the texture of the beef tongue, it was seasoned so well. For the brief amount of time I could stomach the spongeyness, my taste buds were very happy. The hokkaido scallops were AMAZING. I have to admit that one of the pieces wasn't as tender as it should have been, but the seasoning is on point and scallops have always been a favorite. Corn tempura definitely was worth the hype, and the black snapper sashimi was a treat, but not very different from the sashimi you could get from other Japanese restaurants.",4.0
2017,"My highest rating for a great non - Michelin Star restaurant is 4 stars and this place well deserves it. It's a small place.. so 5 of us, with a long sign up sheet and a good amount of people standing outside already waiting, we nearly backed out.. good thing we didn't, because the turnover was pretty fast. Everything was great.. the Corn Tempura we started with was interesting, not bad but I can do without, same goes for the Dried Sandfish, although the wife enjoyed it. Everything else that followed.. I'd eat all day long. Suzuki Carpacio, the Yuba Spoons, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Foie Gras Poele, Saba Shio, and the mixed Sashimi, which was Off The Menu but they're more than willing to prepare one at varying price points. Definitely, going back.",4.0
2018,"Fairly pricey but one of the best spots in Berkeley hands down! The sashimi is a must try, tastes like it came straight from the ocean. The wait can get long especially around peak dinner hours bc the restaurant is small and people tend to take their time so plan ahead but definitely worth it.",5.0
2018,"I love this place sooo much! Good and fresh seafood. Never miss the Yuba and Grilled Squid and they are my favorite. Also, sake there are good. I like the plum sake the best. It is not very strong and with sweet and sour taste. Very fresh!",5.0
2017,"The plates (and for that matter the restaurant) might be small, but they more than compensate in taste. Impressively broad selection of both dishes and sake. I particularly enjoyed all the fried options that I tried, and the jellyfish (which, if you're wondering, does not have the texture you'd expect from its name/appearance).

Definitely make reservations though - while it was worth the hour and a half wait, I imagine it would've been even better without it.",5.0
2015,"Came by for dinner the other night after seeing Jack R's glowing review. Tried making a reservation but they don't accept reservations after the restaurant opens?!? The wait for a table was ~75 minutes. ...there were over half a dozen tables on the list that didn't even show up!

Hits:
- Beef Tataki
- Excellent! Very light and perfectly seared on the outside!
- Roasted Duck
- Came out medium rare and the meat was very tender and fat was minimal!
- Grilled Black Cod
- Well marinated and came out fresh.
- Foie Gras over Daikon
- Foid Gras came out decent, considering that CA just got approval to sell foie gras again!
- Deep fried rock shrimp w/ egg & rice
- Rice was light and fluffy while the rock shrimp was perfect with the tempura batter!

Ok:
- Spinach
- Decent blanched spinach that came out cold. ...the soy sauce was on the salty side though...
- Globe Eggplant w/ Miso
- Dish was slightly oily and salty
- Chicken Karaage
- Flavorful although this was slightly over-fried! :(
- Yuzu Mochi
- Decent...but Crystal Jade in SF does this much better!

~$60/head after tax and tip for dinner!

Parking is plentiful on Telegraph!",4.0
2017,"The restaurant is quite small, we were party of 3 and came in 8pm. We waited in line for almost two hour and finally get in. The food is below my expectations, and limited 2 order of sashimi per table. The plates are small but cute, get to try a lot of different dishes to get full. However, I wouldn't come back if there is such a long wait.",4.0
2015,"I picture my Yelp friend ""Shelley Z"" dining here with her fictitious boyfriend Baymax from Big Hero 6.

Because this is not quite Japan, it's more of a SanFranTokyo or rather a BerkeleyTokyo.

Came here with my buddy Golden Bear (a current UC Berkeley student) to try out their izakaya dishes.

We barely missed the long wait.

We arrived on time when they first opened but each of us were busy playing games on our cell phones, and wound up running to the restaurant to get a seat.

Yes, our time management skills need improvement.

Fortunately, this place was right on point. The dishes came out fairly quickly, and we never felt rushed.

--Uni and crab broccolini was excellent
--Fois Gras with daikon great
--The sashimi salad was a bit overpowering with the bonito flakes (least favorite dish)
---Beef Waygu, one of the best I've had in a long time
---Beef tongue cooked perfectly
--Sashmi was fresh
--- Corn Fritters were amazing! Best fried corn thing I ever had!
-- Dessert panna cotta thing was great!!

So if you're looking for a cool place for your date, be he a huge robot with mad fighting skills and the ability to fly, or a real person, I highly recommend this place!

Or as Baymax would say with a fist pump, ""Ba la la la la!""",5.0
2017,"Came here for the 4.5 star rating, but I think it's definitely overrated.

The only good food I had here was the salmon sashimi and corn tempura.

Most stuff were around average, grilled cod was ok

Shrimp tempura and grilled squid were bad.",2.0
2017,"I think everything was pretty good! I didn't like the ebi spoons for $6 each. They just tasted like spoonfuls of fish (idk why everyone enjoyed it so much). The oysters tasted exactly the same.

What I really enjoyed was the salmon caprici, corn tempura, and beef tataki",4.0
2016,"I love Japanese food. I love tapas. Kiraku successfully marries the two in a beautiful reunion in my mouth. Be prepared to order at least 6 different things here because you'll want to try everything on the menu.

Telegraph isn't known for its fine dining options, but upon stepping into Kiraku, you'll be whisked away into a world of fresh sashimi, homemade tofu, and some of the best skewers I've ever had. Well worth the wait! Great place for celebrations, date, or just to enjoy yourself. Try the raw beef and sashimi platter :)

I always leave wanting more! Food comes promptly and you'll find yourself wanting to hog all the food for yourself",5.0

2018,"I hate to give this place 5 stars because it will get even busier.  It's small and it's cramped and you're gonna have to wait but the wait it worth and the small cramped space adds to the experience. This place is so much more than good food, it's a true experience. The prices are reasonable unless you order the entire menu, which is an option because you don't want to miss anything! I'd go back more often if I was willing to wait, so I save this spot for a special treat.",5.0
2015,"This little gem (seats around 35 people) is literally a 5 minute walk from my apartment in Berkeley. I've always been intimidated with the groups of people standing on the sidewalk outside waiting (think Burma Superstar). I found out that they take reservations but probably need to make them well in advance. If you arrive at 5:15 p.m. as a walk-in,  you will likely be seated right when they open at 5:30 p.m. Come later than that and well.... you will be waiting at least an hour, if not more. Bring along a friend you have been meaning to catch up with, as you will have LOTS of time to do this! We happily discovered that if you are waiting just inside the door in the two seats by the door, they will serve you beer while you wait!!! They also will take your order when you are getting close to being seated :)))

All of the dishes I've tried here are DELISH! My favs are the corn tempura with green tea salt, buta-kim (sauteed pork and kimchi with poached egg), jumbo squid, and roasted duck. The chicken karaage (deep fried bite-sized chicken) is tasty but not sure I'd order this regularly as it's very filling and I need room in my stomach for all the other amazing treats here.

I hate waiting but both my friend and I agreed it was worth the 1.5 hour wait! Our bill came to $85 (plus tax and tip) and was well worth it. LOVE this place!!",5.0
2017,"This is a SOLID 4.5 stars. Got in almost immediately with our resi, otherwise be prepared to wait. There were a couple of Japanese families waiting when we got there, another sign this place must be legit. I usually don't eat where the locals would not eat so I knew I was in for a treat.

Pardon my identification of the items but I'm sure you'll get the idea. The kitchen does a great job of pacing the dishes even though we ordered quite a few items. We started with the spicy tuna/taro, it seemed a bit weird off on the initial bite but soon discovered it was a matter of assembly, be sure to use a healthy scoop of filling topped with greens for the proper finish of the wrap your own dish. It was one my faves. The thin sliced fish topped with togarashi and yuzu was pretty much standard fare but beautiful execution. Finally to finish out the first three, we had the corn tempura, I have to admit its unique dish with excellent ingredients, the green tea salt topper really rounded out the dish.

The next three consisted of the waygu beef tataki, which was super thin sliced high quality super rare beef. It was tend and tasty however I expected more marbling of our dish to add another layer of sensation, however I'd get it again. The chopped beef potato croquettes were light and fluffy, all wrapped in delicate crisp crust, nothing mind blowing but nicely done. Finally for this round we had the fried chicken cartilage, the ultimate Japanese bar snack. They are an acquired item and will probably not suit western tastes, however me and my SO were fighting for the last piece crispy fried chicken joint, what I'd call real chicken popcorn.

Finally to finish out the experience we had grilled beef intestine skewer, beefy offal w/just the right blend of richness and smokey grilled pleasure cut with a fruit based balsamic like dressing, yummy. Of course dinner would not be complete without the waitress recommended frozen cheesecake, she said its one of the few items they make from scratch, she was right. Chunks of frozen cheese cake with a citrus sauce and two cookies to balance it all out.

We ordered mostly off their specials menu and want come back to try the rest. We'll definitely be back!",5.0
2017,"I have nothing but love for Kiraku!

Went here with a friend, had to wait some 30 minutes to get in. Not too bad. Once we got seated, we already knew our orders right away, seeing the menu while waiting. Service was really fast, all the servers were super nice and checked on us frequently.

We got the Wagyu Beef Tataki, Grilled Edamame, and Sweet Potato Tempura. Specials for that night: seven kinds of Sashimi, and Grilled Snow Crab Legs. Everything was divine.

Favorite for that night were the crab legs... Meat just slid off the shells so cleanly and so beautifully.

Price is definitely worth it.

Tips: Come in early. Also, you'll probably have better luck with parking a couple blocks down.",5.0
2018,"This place is incredible!! Favorites were the Wagyu tataki, Yubu spoons (the uni was so sweet!!), Suzuki carpaccio, corn tempura, seared Saba sashimi, Kaisen Don.. who am I kidding, honestly all our food was amazing and was def worth the hour long wait. I recommend getting a reservation or be prepared to wait at least an hour (we came at 7:30). Service was also awesome! I felt like I was back in Japan! Will be coming back!!",5.0
2016,"If there was 6 stars, that would be my review!  This place is absolutely amazing!

We had the garlic edamame, sea bass Suzuki, wagyu beef, beef tongue, 5 piece sashimi, and some other items what I don't remember.

First off, if the part of menu is in Japanese and most of the people sitting around you are Japanese, this should clue you in that this is NOT your regular street corner sushi restaurant.  Do not waltz in there expecting to order rolls with cream cheese or mayo poured all over your sushi.  This restaurant serves small, omakase style plates.

Great place and highly recommended!  One of the best places I've eaten at.",5.0
2017,"We are from out of town and family suggested that we go here.  We went on a Saturday evening around 7:20p and placed our name on the list outside for 4 people.  I read from other reviews that you may call to make reservations as long as you commit to paying at least $40 a head.  I figured that we could easily spend that much.  However, no one had answered the phones so sadly- no reservation.  We waited almost 2 hours but IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  The FRIED CHICKEN CARTILAGE and the BEEF INTESTINE was the consensus for the favorite dishes of the night.  But everything we ordered was delicious anyway.  You won't be disappointed!

By the time that we were seated and about 15 minutes into our meal, there were empty tables anyway.  I guess we could have just come at the later time and not waited.  We even had a couple of family members come join us towards the end because we told them there were empty tables. So we ended up having about 6 people total. Our total check came out to be $180 including tip.",5.0

Long wait without reservations; $40/pp minimum for a reservation and you still have to wait. Restaurant is charming, but small and cramped.

2014,"Ok, I must have really high expectations when it comes to sushi... Well I guess being Vancouver kind of does that for you (for those of you who don't know, Vancouver is sort of like the Sushi capital of North America). Yes, in the freezing cold white north!

Anywho, went to Kiraku after seeing rave reviews and bomb photos and was slightly disappointed. Was hoping for a authentic and unique izakaya but it turned out to be sort of like a ""typical"" sushi joint with a few little robata sticks here and there. Also the prices are really steep, and that's coming from someone who will dish out on Japanese food. Had the pesto yakiudon, mini rice bowl, Kiraku duck and some other appetizers. Nothing really stood out for me, even the pesto yakiudon which I expected to be something unique. The Kiraku duck which apparently is really good, was ""meh"" it was just seared duck cut thinly with teriyaki sauce. The seasoning and food isn't bad, it just isn't memorable or standout in any way. The service is also a little spotty since its small and there are a lot of people. Be prepared to wait for a table!",3.0
2014,"Not sure why people don't make reservations.  INSANE to wait, when there is an easy efficient alternative.  

Super small space, but surprisingly comfortable, as we were seated with only one neighbor.  Very energetic and loud environment.  I actually didn't mind.  Became a nice backdrop to the meal.  

Servers are prompt, professional and didn't pass judgment when we went through our laundry list order.  The tea and water service could be a bit more spiffy, as their vessels are small.

Nothing felt greasy or heavy during the meal.  None of the dreaded phlegm.  BIG plus in my book.  

A couple items were a smidge salty for me:
-spicy hamachi kama, nice exterior crust, maintained moisture inside
-wagyu tataki, sauce on the side next time

One miss:
-spicy jellyfish, I like the unadorned Chinese version more, too saucy

Tummy approved:
-anchovy broccoli
-Yuba, uni and roe spoons, luxurious balance
-fried cartilage, wow, not expected, seasoned PERFECTLY
-sashimi combo, fantastic
-kiraku salad, light dressing, fresh greens and fried garlic
-rock shrimp tempura, spicy, tender shrimp
-kimchi, rivals any Korean
-duck, must order, loved this
-mini kaisen donburi, perfect rice, a nice smattering of ingredients on top, so good
-blanc manger, lovely way to end meal, light, creamy, silky mouth feel

Their wasabi is top notch.  Use sparingly, will clear up your sinuses.

Try the sake flights, they bring out the bottles, explain and pour at your table.  

Genuine care and attention is brought forth here, as evidenced by the warm towels presented at the start of the meal.  Meticulously prepared food.

They have a variety of small plates that suite many different moods such as corn tempura, ramen, bata kim, etc. The plum wine is also delectable and the service is very quick!

In the end, we got 3 corn fritters, 2 pork belly skewers, and an order of premium grilled beef tongue. The corn fritters were extra oily. The pork belly skewers were average at best.

2016,"Situated in college town Berkeley, this local izakaya can gather quite a substantial following on a daily basis, so if you're so inclined to trek across the bridge to dine here, I highly recommended a ressie. Bear in mind that a ressie requires an obligatory 30$ per head to reserve your spot, which my party had no problem in spending within our first 10 minutes. To say the restaurant is small is an understatement, it's down right cramped. You might as well get to know your neighbors because you'll be able to smell their perfume and hear every utterance of their intimate conversation. With that in mind, the environs are energetic and vibrant as expected from this genre of dining but more importantly is the food right? Well, I'll admit that the cuisine did not disappoint, considering I ordered most of the local favorites, like the fragrant garlic edamame, crispy fried corn and wagyu beef tataki. Among the favorites, however, I did venture out a bit and opted for some of the specials of the evening, which included the fresh scallop sashimi. Imported from Japan, these majestic medallions were supple and fleshy with a perfect soft and buttery texture and mouthfeel. Absolutely outstanding! Now back to the favorites, which were no also ran IMO. Let's start with the fried corn, OMG...to.die.for. It's bar food at its best. Seriously, the corn comes in this interesting honeycomb-like presentation. Once you break away a piece of the corn, the texture is light and airy but the crunch, once it hits your mouth, is amazingly good. Especially when the batter they coat it with has a hint of irresistible sweetness. Like kettle corn, it's initially a little salty but it finishes with a surprisingly light, sweet flavor. A winning combination IMO. Among other notable favorites were the insanely tender beef tongue skewers. It literally tasted like slow roasted beef. Incredibly soft and infinitely satisfying. Speaking of soft, the wagyu beef tataki was easily one of my favorites. The beef was tender and exhibited beautiful marbling. That alone had me drooling for my first decadent bite! And boy oh boy was the first bite blissful. Tender soft and velvety mouthfeel giving way to a subtle permeating flavor that it literally melted in my mouth.  Last but not least, was the delightful duck. Sliced ultra thin, the duck was cooked to a perfectly pink center. The flavor profiles were subtle with a permeating flavor paired wonderfully with the soft and velvety duck. I washed it down with extra dry Asahi draft in a chilled glass with shots of sake for good measure. In regards to service, the wait staff, which was comprised of a handful of sweet gals, were very friendly and quite efficient. All in all, a fantastic first experience at Kiraku and easily not the last time I'll be dining at this charming neighborhood favorite.

2017,"Great place to have Japanese tapas. We been to Kiraku a number of times and never been disappointed. Everything we ordered are quality and prepared superbly. The place is very very casual and not for romantic evening. From my experience, group of 4 works out good because you could get at least 10-12 different selections.",4.0
2016,"This pricey Japanese tapas restaurant is worth every penny spent. It's very tiny and very popular, so either come early or be prepared to wait. The hours are a bit weird so be sure to check before you come.

My favorites are the corn tempura, uni & ikura spoon bite, and pesto udon.

Corn Tempura - crispy deep-fried corn fritters; sweet and filled with lots of corn; sprinkled with matcha; tastes best when hot; great appetizer

Uni & Ikura - bite-sized cold appetizer; sweet, fresh uni; salty, fresh ikura (roe) that pops in your mouth; very sophisticated flavor; tastes like the ocean!

Pesto Udon - awesome drunchies; filling, creamy, basil pesto sauce coating the udon and forming a slightly ""soupy"" base; al dente udon; mushrooms in the dish add a nice textural contrast

There are plenty of other delicious dishes as well, like the skewers (specifically pork belly - flavorful, juicy), various meat dishes (very tender), and the spicy jellyfish appetizer (cold, tangy, goes great with meat dishes).

Overall, this is a great place to visit only once in a while, as it can get quite pricey. They have sake tasting sampler so it's a great place to come to de-stress as well. ;)",4.0
2016,"This is the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to in Berkeley! Everything we ordered was so delicious! The sashimi was very fresh! The quality was really good. The chicken cartilage was nice! The grilled port looked fat, but it tasted well done. And the fish was also pretty good.  It was costly (we two spent $108 including beer and sake before tip), but it was worthy!
The service was also great. There were lots choices of sake! The waitress knew all sake there that she could explain to us the differences between each one. Btw, there are always many people waiting in line outside so it's better to arrive there on 5:30 pm so that you won't have to wait if you don't have reservation.",5.0
2017,"Oktowasabi was the favorite, but really don't think you can go wrong. Jellyfish would be a close second. Enjoyed Interesting options like corn tempura, the sweet friend clumped corn, was a new experience.

This place is very pretentious. I walked in at 5:25pm, 5 min. before they open. I went to use the bathroom. Afterward I sat at one of a single tables near the window. The place was still empty, only me. The staff asked me to get up and go sit at the waiting area near the entrance on the cold day and the door was wide open. I looked at my phone it was 5:28pm, 2 min. before open. They insisted me to wait at the waiting area for 2 min. I should have left, but I was hungry so I waited out. The staffs were UNFRIENDLY, no smile and only interested to get you in and out as fast as they can have more turn over.

2014,"Unique flavors, a must try!

***The MUST GETS:***

Beef Tongue with Truffle Oil and Sea Salt
- cooked to tenderness, truffle oil tastes great on anything, putting the two together is amazing!

Pork with Soft Boiled Egg and mustard
- amazing flavor with tender pork!  the runny egg yolks + broth + mustard makes a great dipping medium for the pork.

Roasted Tea Blanc Manger
- strong tea flavored dessert and unique, goes down smooth and is easy to eat after the meal

Yuzu Mochi
- i'm a fan of yuzu anything (broths, sorbets, etc.) this mochi is soft and the filling is creamy with the great fragrance of the citrusy fruit

**The GOOD:**

Chazuke
- rice with all kinds of toppings and pot of dashi broth, feels very clean and fresh, very authentic style!

Pork with Kimchi and Poached Egg
- egg yolks are always a win in my book, the kimchi was sweet and provided lots of flavor however the strips of pork were not great.

Sweet Potato Brulee
- certainly unique and tastes exactly how it sounds

*The OK:*

Yaki Udon
- very fusion considering it had pesto.  i'm a fan of basil but this combination with the fish flakes didn't do it for me. it was also pretty salty. octopus was nice and chewy however.

Corn Tempura with Green Tea Sea Salt
- tempura anything and i'm a happy camper.  this is more savory than it is sweet, the corn is like reminds me of the chewy non-sugary vietnamese corn you get frozen at asian markets

---The Meh: ----

Kiraku Duck
- good flavor but dry meat

Pork Belly
- tasty miso paste however it was not juicy as expected

it's a treat when you find a japanese place that doesn't only serve sushi/udon/tonkatsu.  I appreciate that this place offers very different food and that the majority of the food is of great quality and taste.  service is friendly and they really do understand how long the customers have waited in the cold outside.  Honestly this place is worth a try at least once, it has certainly expanded my Japanese-food-horizon",4.0
2017,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good.

Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down.",5.0
2016,"Such a hidden gem. I used to live on parker/telegraph and didn't try this place until after I moved.

Food:

- Corn Tempura: So crispy and tasty! MUST TRY item. Very filling but also light.

- Karaage: You can never go wrong with fried chicken. YUM!

- Pork Belly: Very tasty. They don't give you much so I didn't think the price made up for what you got, but it melted in your mouth.

Fast and good service. The place is smaller so if you come later it gets pretty busy, but when I went the wait wasn't too long. Portions are small since they're tapas but they fill you up.",5.0
2018,Just realized I haven't written a review to this place. This is one of our favorite restaurants in the Bay Area! Everything here is just perfect! We have been here so many times and it never fails us. We have recommended it to a lot of our friends and they all love it! The freshness and the flavor just simply blow your mind. One time we had to wait for three hours to get a table but it worths every minute of our waiting time. Order whatever you want on the menu because they all taste great! Must try their sashimi!,5.0
2014,"DON'T BE LATE!

Early dinner or late lunch or whatever! I had the pleasure of dining here and through the authority of local knowledge we got to the restaurant at the top of the 5 o clock hour. No sooner than sitting, before our first sip of sake! Yikes... the little restaurant filled up where no empty tables remained. Top that? A sign in sheet for people waiting (the wait can be as long as an hour so far as I could see- I did the math)

Located on the fringe of college town UC Berkeley sits Kiraku a japan izakaya which holds not more than 30 diners at a sitting. Fresh fresh fish (we had the sashimi sampler consisting of kampachi, hottori, and black snapper= my favorite was the  hottori)! grilled meats (we had the grilled tongue, yep! tongue which was doused with a sweet soy glaze) Tempura style!! CORN! tasty (a bit salty for my taste but loved it anyway) and to end our meal? chazuke with all the right condiments... hits the spot!

Oh oh! Wait! the sake? Junmai Ginjo (my favorite of sakes) Maboroshi. Never tried that varietal before... It was not too fruity! Not too dry!! It was almost perfect.

Sidebar: patrons spanned the spectrum as I saw students (from Berkeley up the road), visitors (like myself) and a large group of business men (from Japan). Now my theory is that a restaurant who attracts their native tastebud must be good!",5.0
2015,"Most people will probably hate me for giving them only 2 stars, but when you read the entire review...you will understand why.

My younger sister & I showed up on a Friday evening--July 10th, to be exact.  We got there around 6:45 and waited 2 hours to get a table & I'm not exaggerating on the wait time.

We were already seated at a table for 4, and a group of 4 people came in after us so they asked us to move to a smaller table, which a couple had just left, and we were kind enough to do so.

We ordered a few items:

1) Suzuki carpaccio - light and flavorful, very tasty

2) Whole squid - simple, yet still flavorful

3) Pork belly kakuni - simply delicious!

4) Duck breast - under cooked so it was a little tough

5) Beef tongue with truffle oil - too rare, weird after taste because of too much truffle oil?

All I have to say is that the food was good & the service was also good, but why the 2 stars, you say?

Well, I went home and got really sick.  I was throwing up all night and I knew exactly what caused it too.  It was the beef tongue.  If not handled or cooked correctly, it will cause you to get sick because the tongue carries a lot of bacteria.  My sister got lucky because it was the only item that she didn't eat.

2014,"Kiraku is so good that I'm writing a Yelp review after my dinner there tonight, even though I have a final exam the next moring -_-

It's spoken about more in the circles of older people i.e. people who just graduated, because undergrads tend to be preoccupied by OB Chicken and Thalassa.  I've heard good things about this place but was never able to come because they have limited hours (dinner only, Wed through Sun).  

It serves Japanese tapas so is quite similar to Ippuku, with less élan considering there are no little wooden booths or exotic zen music, and it's actually well lit like a normal restaurant.  The menu can be a little overwhelming, so I suggest doing your research ahead of time.  On the other hand, everything we decided on exceeded my expectations, so if it sounds good I don't think you could go wrong.

(+) Albacore yuzu ceviche ($9): very good sashimi quality, and you could actually taste a lot more than just lime.  The parsley, thinly sliced onions, and tomatoes complemented the sashimi nicely.

(+) Chazuke ($7), rice in dashi broth w/ choice of Plum, Salmon, Takana, or Mentaiko (Cod Roe): we chose the salmon and though there were only two small pieces, it was very tender and delicious.  It's a very interesting dish, unexpectedly a mound of rice submerged in the dashi broth and topped with the salmon, garnished with seaweed flakes and wasabi on the side.  I bet even ramen snobs would approve of this dashi broth.  I'm not a fan of soups, but this was tasty and comforting like chicken noodle soup (only extremely fancy and Asian).  

(+) Roasted duck Kiraku style ($13.5): in a mad scramble to consult Yelp for menu recommendations, I saw a lot of people liked the duck so we ordered it.  It's served on a long plate similar to sushi.  The duck itself is good quality and well marinated.  It seems expensive, but you can tell a lot of thought went into this dish--each piece is beautiful, with a thin layer of skin.  Among the best duck I've had (along with Great China Peking duck).

Everything looks small portion-wise, but it's very flavorful and actually fills you up.  The total was $18 per person, which is the same price I paid last time I went to Ippuku.  Since it's tapas, I suggest coming here with a lot of people so you can try more of the fascinating-sounding menu items.

The wait is not impossible like it is at Ippuku, but I still suggest coming early or making a reservation because it's a small place.  

It's difficult to say whether Kiraku or Ippuku is better.  Ippuku focuses on robatayaki and other grilled specialties, while Kiraku has unique, almost fusion-type tapas.  One advantage is that since there is no grill, the dishes don't take forever like they do at Ippuku, and you don't walk out of dinner wreathing in a savory, oily smoke.",5.0
2016,"Awesome dining experience! Expect to spend $40/person excluding drinks. Food quality is off-the-wall for that price!

Faves were the donburi and salmon carpaccio, but everything we had deserved 5-stars. The sea urchin was so fresh... mmm... see attached pics.

Good for small groups as the restaurant is small. Wait time was 1 hr for two of us on a Friday night, but Totally worth it! and I normally wouldn't say that about most things. After you put your name on the sign in list, you can walk around the area... Up Telegraph Ave toward campus, or get a beer or shaved ice across the street while waiting.",5.0

2015,"Positives: Hard to overeat & quality of food was excellent. Service was fast and all the servers were friendly.

I guess I should've noticed that these were Japanese tapas, so food came one at a time and in small portions. I thought it was pretty overpriced for the entree items, considering the lamb chops we ordered were tiny at $15. I'm not a big fan of sashimi, but supposedly that's what most people order. I thought the kimchi ($4) was just okay-- honestly, most kimchi tastes the same most places you go; it often just varies on the range of spiciness. But the steak sirloin (1 skewer at $4.50) was probably the best part of the meal. It was tender and not too salty. The marinade was tasty and they sprinkled some green onion onto it. We ordered the rice ball and karaage but they weren't anything too special. I don't think that they were worth getting; I think their specialty was probably seafood or steak.

I don't know if I would come back considering they're often very busy and it would take awhile to get a table. I've passed by it before and people would be waiting outside. The dining area is very small and a lot of the tables are really close to each other; it's not a place to go if you want to have a serious conversation with someone. The music is pretty loud (especially in the bathroom) and you're right next to another table of people, so they could easily hear what you're saying. But all in all, I would say it's not worth it if you're hungry.",3.0

They take reservations if each person spends at least $30 (which is not a big deal)

Parking: Street parking. It's difficult to find parking around this area, so I would aim to show up 15 minutes before reservation to find parking.

Service: Everyone there was very responsive and very polite! They offer very helpful recommendations if you're unsure of what to order

Food Highlights:

Grilled squid: AMAZING! The texture was not too chewy. It was seasoned very well (not too salty). It also comes with a yummy dipping sauce.

Roasted beef tongue: This dish was salted perfectly, not chewy at all, and melts in your mouth. It also has a little truffle oil lightly drizzled over it that added a very nice touch.

Sashimi: Their sashimi was very fresh. The few times I've come, they had imported sea scallops and tuna from Japan. The scallops were ""sweet"" very tasty and the tuna melted in your mouth. the rest of the sashimi was also very fresh and tasty.

Broccoli and Anchovy: I didn't expect to like this very much, it was a nice contrast. The anchovy was not too fishy and was salty enough to bring out the natural taste of the broccoli.

Sashimi Salad: I wouldn't order this again. It seemed like random small pieces of fish over a lettuce mix with a light vinaigrette. It wasn't anything special to me.

Overall, I enjoyed this restaurant and would recommend it to everyone! The tapas style also allows you to get a small taste of everything!",5.0

Favorites:
-- Scallop from Hokkaido and black snapper sashimi: both are extremely fresh. The scallop is a must
-- Broccolini with uni: great ingredients and balance of flavor, definitely recommended
-- cucumber with Miso: a bit of spicy flavor in the miso, just enough to pique one's appetite
-- Karaage: fantastic, really tender
-- Grilled miso cod: solid, tender cod, just the right amount of sauce and the right taste for the sauce (not too thick, watery, or sweet) for the cod
-- spicy stewed beef tongue: thin slices of beef tongue which is a bit chewy but cooked just right.
-- Kiraku duck: this is probably the most ordinary dish, reminding me of a french/american duck fillet cut to slices.

There was quite a wait, but definitely worth it. The sashimi was fresh and delicious, and we got a few other Japanese tapas, everything was good.

I always start out with corn tempura and Ashai draft beer. Their beer is amazing because they perfectly foam the top and the first sip of the beer taste is almost one of the best draft beers I had.

Then Chicken cartilage is another favorite. The dish looks simple but texture(?) is amazing. It is a perfect dish that goes well with the beer.

2015,"Utterly speechless though still able to articulate with a keyboard!  Originally slated to be a simple, tasty meal after some sour beer tasting nearby, I could not have expected to be blindsided as hard as I did here.  An early arrival within fifteen minutes of opening landed us a table immediately and we were off to what would ultimately be Disneyland for our taste buds!

Our first wave hailed from the grilled section and included skewers of tender beef tongue and black pork belly.  That tongue was unlike preparation I've had prior in its demarcations between areas of muscle and fat that lent to much textural contrast.  The yuzu miso sauce matched almost symbiotically in its slightly sweet umami-ness.  The perfectly seasoned belly was likewise the most balanced I've yet come across in its lightly charred richness.

Being a lover of whole grilled squid, I was blown away by its cook as even the legs were delightfully tender with the slightest chew to give each piece some substance.  Do go for the very tip of the head as that was particularly loaded with flavor.  Classics including black cod and hamachi kama were excellently prepared and easily on par with the likes of Nobu, Morimoto, O Ya, etc.

Moving into the daily menu, homemade tofu skin came ensconced in spoons and topped with ikura and mad fresh sea urchin - a great pairing and one where the tofu was allowed to really shine.  Fans of cruciferous vegetables will be happy to know that the chef here is an absolutely master of them as both the cool-temped snow crab and broccolini and sauteed anchovy broccoli possessed that exact right amount of crunch.  And in fact, the emanating heat and bold flavors of the latter reminded me of the freakishly tasty ones at Girl & the Goat.

Slices of shime saba were mad fresh and particularly delicate in their saltiness, unlike any saba sashimi I've tasted before and served with freshly grated wasabi.  A girl at a neighboring table apparently ordered a sashimi sampler of some kind...did we need to know what was on it before getting one for ourselves?  Of course not.  Toro, bluefin tuna, scallop and sake, all just as top notch as the saba.  The absolute star of these raw offerings, however, was the fresh octopus carpaccio from Hokkaido - its accompanying crunchy plum flakes added a grounded earthiness that, combined with the acidity and crispness of the greens and dressing, made for an exceptionally complete dish with serious depth.

Going with our penchant for quality protein, Canadian black pork kakuni simmered in soy sauce exploded with fatty goodness while the roasted duck Kiraku style provided unfussy, ducky awesomeness...possibly more, certainly no less.  And on that note, foie gras was available here too atop daikon radish - a lovely contrast between the richness of the former and the mellow juiciness of the latter.

At this point, we'd already lost track of what we'd ordered...yet the derriciousness of it all begged us to grab just a few more dishes.   Namely, a trio of tuna (simmered, poke-style and salad) that showcased a fantastic array of flavor profiles, decadent grilled bone marrow and an ultimate black snapper poeler with squid ink risotto that had the airiest creaminess.  

Just about stuffed to the fullest, we knew we still had to keep up our tradition of sampling the desserts when the savory offerings knock it out of the park.  Thankfully, deciding which ones wasn't a problem as we ordered all of them...and a second round of that roasted tea blanc-manger - other worldly in its delicateness like that of panna cotta and so wonderfully true in roasted tea flavor.  Close behind, the homemade grapefruit yogurt ice cream redefined ""refreshing"" while the yuzu mochi sourced from a mystery provider in LA was the best yet especially with its citrusy brightness and unparalleled softness.  Even softer than...err, something that should probably just be kept amongst me and my nomming companions ;)

Throughout this crazy amazing adventure of a meal, the wonderful staff here took excellent care of us.  Kampai to Gaby especially for being so awesome and sharing some of the Tamagawa ""Kinsho"" that opened us up to the world of sake.  And to round it all out, I was touched when the chef and owner's wife came out to personally pour us some of her favorite dessert sake to pair with our desserts.  Sunai (sp?) was such a sweetheart and the most gracious of hosts.

For anyone still reading my ramblings to this point, nice job!  But in all honesty, Kiraku was an absolute mind blow in a way that I thought not possible.  Now among my top 3 restaurants of all-time and requiring a return visit very soon!",5.0

2016,"Yum! I would've gave a 5 star review if my partner and I were given good service in the beginning of our seating. Nonetheless, I did have a great time enjoying the atmosphere and the food was very delicious. It's a Saturday night and the CAL football game was on the same day, I understood that this restaurant was packed! The wait was a little longer than I've liked in this cold temperature, but it was average! I expected to wait a long time to be seated, but it was less than 30 minutes and we got ourselves a table.

Upon walking in, the place is small, but cozy. They atmosphere was good and the workers are friendly as well. However, in the beginning it did take them quite a bit for them to service us; again, understandable that it was busy and seemed they didn't have enough staff to service a full house. I've stumbled upon this place while searching for a new place to try out. I've never really had good experience with small plates/tapas. I'm particularly picky and hard to satisfy sometimes, so I was thoroughly impressed with their dishes. They have daily menus that changes weekly, so you get to try something different. I'm assuming the menu will be based on ingredients they buy that week!

* I've ordered the sake sampler from the drink menu, i liked it to some extent as someone who wants to try new things. I have low tolerance in alcohol, so I couldn't finish it.. that's too bad! Hopefully next time, I'll be able to.
* Wagyu beef tataki and keep in mind, I had it at a few location, it didn't really impress me. However, this dish was very delicious!
* Black Pork Belly Skewer w/ homemade spicy Miso was the bomb! I really enjoyed it. The flavor was great and you can taste the flavor of it being grilled. I loved it.
* Tender Beef Tongue Skewer w/ yuzu Miso sauce had an unique taste to it, it was good but it's probably something I wouldn't order again anytime soon.
* Jumbo Squid, a whole squid that is grilled and coated with teriyaki sauce!! They had this dipping sauce which mixed well with the squid, I've had decent squid before and this one met my standards of deliciousness!
* Roasted Premium Angus Beef Tongue w/ truffle oil and smoked salt, each individual slice of meat was so tender and seasoned nicely, the truffle oil didn't over power anything and I was able to taste the authenticity of the meat, the smoked salt just ties it all up!
* Yuzu Chicken Udon has this citrus flavor soup, which was every tasty and I enjoyed every bit of it! It was so flavorful, I wanted to drink all the soup, but I was so stuffed by the end of our meal...

To end our date night dinner, we ordered the greentea icecream with coconut greentea mochi! It came with a very generous scoop of greentea ice cream and unsweetened red bean, little bit of whip cream! Yummy, I would come back again to try different things on their menu! I was on cloud 9!",4.0
2016,"Delicious Japanese food!! It is tapas-style, so you can taste a variety of yummy eats here at Kiraku. It is quite expensive, so this is definitely for those special occasions. I went with my boyfriend here and we got a total of 4 dishes (2 meat and 2 sea foods). It was an amazing combination - I highly recommend it!

We started off our dinner with a sweet plum sake that I will definitely be getting again. My favorite dish was the grilled beef tongue, which is an explosion of truffle in your mouth. The wrapped salmon was also a favorite with its flaky texture and yummy sautéed mushrooms. We also got the roasted duck Kiraku style and the salted hamachi Kama, which were definitely yummy but nothing really spectacular. We ended the night with 2 of their refreshing and sweet ice creams - green tea and grapefruit yogurt sorbet. You just have to taste them for yourself to pick your favorite! Have fun!",4.0
2013,"Izakaya in Berkeley? I so didn't know, but great choice!

Tip of the day: This fine eatery is very small and fills up pretty quick.

Luckily we came at the right time and were seated right away. Service was on point, our server was very knowledgeable on all specials & items. Very friendly I might add and loved her Japanese accent. With so many choices on the menu & served tapas style, why not order a lot?!

What did we order?

Corn tempura-Picture corn tempura w/green seat salt-My favorite!!

Agedashi tofu-first thoughts was bland, but after adding the sauce and flakes made it better

Rock shrimp tempura-spicy/tangy flavors-delicious

Wagyu beef-tender/flavorful

Pork belly skewers-I heart swine

Japanese duck potstickers-Very different compared to pork, but thumbs up

Kampachi sashimi-Yum-fresh/melts in your mouth

Sashimi salad- burst of delicious flavors

Saba-Kind of salty but doable

A final word to the wise: Don't lose track of your spending. At most Izakaya's you tend to order so much, but I found Kiraku worthy and plan to make a trip back.

2016,"We came here on a Saturday evening at 5:10pm. I recommend being the first 5 on the list to even be the first group of people to eat. There are many things that we haven't tired. However, The Beef Tataki was AMAZING, very juicy and tender. Another thing was the corn tempura and the different types of skewers.

Fast and good service.",4.0
2015,"It's just as good as everyone says it is. We've been searching for decent izakaya places here in the Bay Ara every since experiencing the Japanese version of tapas in Toronto. With Kiraku I think we've found pretty much as good as it gets.

First, the things I don't like- the stoopid reservation policy ($30 minimum and 1 drink minimum), the smallness of the restaurant, being asked if we'll be done by a certain time, limited parking. You know- stoopid things that only Berkeley restaurants seem to be able to get away with.

But the food here is actually pretty wonderful.

The dishes we really liked: chicken karaage, corn tempura (very original), rock shrimp tempura, roasted duck (perfectly cooked), roast pork with egg, pork belly skewers, beef and taro croquettes, albacore ceviche, agedashi tofu (our least favorite though- the sauce was thicker than we expected), sashimi salad

The dishes we didn't like:

So yeah, we liked everything. I would go early to this restaurant (like before they open) and put your name on their list if you want to avoid the wait. But do try this little Japanese place. With so many pretenders in the Berkeley food scene I'm happy to say this one is the real deal.",5.0
2017,"Don't miss this hidden gem! Fine Dinning quality food in a laid back atmosphere. After every bite I'd put down my chopsticks, close my eyes and savory the amazing flavor combinations. Plates are small and pricy, the focus is much more on quality over quantity.  

I recommend the sashimi platter if they have it, we all agreed it was the best sashimi we'd ever had.

The seating is a little cramped, but it's well worth it for the outstanding eats.",5.0
2015,"The most delicious izakaya I've ever been to. There's a minimum order amount if you make a reservation ($30 per person I think?) but it's not a hard limit to hit.

I love the grilled squid, the corn fritter, and the different hamachi dishes.

My favorite dish is definitely the beef tataki but I'm a biased carnivore.",5.0
2014,"Wow. Why have I not tried this place before??

I went to Berkeley, but this place opened up shortly after I graduated. I guess that's a good thing, I may have eaten all of my dinners here.

I went here with the boyfriend's fam and we didn't think we were going to make it before they closed. Apparently as long as you're though the door before 11pm (closing) they'll still serve you.

ADVICE:
- Don't drive! Their alcohol looks too enticing to drink with the yummy food you get.
- Eating with three to four people is most optimal. You get to try more dishes with more people. 8 dishes the bill came out to $92 + tax.

Service was impeccable despite our late arrival. We couldn't tell it was late because the service was consistent throughout the meal.

2015,"it doesn't get much better than this for food. Japanese tapas style. there are lots of specials and plenty of regular daily menu items

our favorite was a daily special of striped bass carpaccio with spicy red pepper chilis. we ordered it twice. next favorite was raw oyster with fresh uni, so good. angus beef tongue was very good. pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth good. pork and kimchi was okay, not great. as mentioned the corn tempura was really nice. sweet and not heavy.

the place is tiny and without a reservation the wait is crazy. we had a reservation and had to wait about 10 minutes which was okay. every table that got up passed us waiting at the door on the way out said ""it's worth it"" which it was haha. service is pretty good considering how small and cramped it is. pretty good selection of sake and soju too.

we'll definitely be back, but not without a reservation!",5.0
2015,"This is my second time here, and it was just as good! This time, my family and I ordered the corn tempura, beef tataki, grilled squid, maze gohan, rock shrimp tendon and oyakodon. Though this place is a little pricey, it's probably one of the best Japanese restaurants in Berkeley. On a previous occasion, I ordered the grilled beef tongue, which was also delicious.

Corn tempura is one of Kiraku's signatures in that it's unique to them; I have yet to find a place that has this also. The corn is nicely fried and seasoned with salt. It's crunchy, but once you bite into it, you can taste the juices from the corn. It's a must order when you come here!

Tataki means that a piece of meat is seared and then sliced into pieces; I mistakenly ordered this instead of the grilled Angus beef tongue, but this is good too! The beef tataki is light, and a super thin slice of meat. The meat is nicely cut and dissolves in your mouth upon arrival. I personally like the beef tongue more because it's a thicker cut, juicier, and has more seasoning.

The presentation of the squid was very appealing in that they kept the shape of the squid intact but just cut it into smaller pieces after being grilled. The squid was perfectly grilled; well cooked but not burnt.

The maze gohan is salmon fried rice topped with ikura (salmon eggs). The fried rice is simple with cooked salmon pieces, and it was super flavorful especially with the addition of the ikura, which is on the saltier side.

The oyakodon and rock shrimp tendon were both of smaller portions and had the meat and egg mixture on top of the rice. It was simple and good; it's great Japanese comfort food. Nicely seasoned with salt. The rock shrimp were little pieces of shrimp that were fried instead of the traditional, long shrimp tempura.

I came for a late dinner, and there was still a long wait; I waited for approximately 30 minutes, but once you get your order in, the food comes out pretty quickly (less than 10 minutes). I definitely will be coming here again to get my fix of Japanese food in the future.",5.0
2017,"Corn tempura, beef tongue, kimchi, cartilage, taco wasa, sashimi and so much more! Awesome along with phenomenal service!",5.0
2017,"Kiraku is incredible and not overhyped at all. I've been here four? five? times and everything is delicious and worth the wait.

Getting a table:
- they start seating at 5:30 -- if you want to be seated in the first shift, I would try to get there an hour in advance and leave your name. there's a heat lamp outside in cold weather but it's still pretty chilly. if you don't make it in the first wave you will probably be seated closer to 7, so just be warned
- it's not very big -- I wouldn't recommend large groups (6+) without a reservation. going solo or with one other person is best for getting a table, but it's nice to go with 2-3 other people for dish variety
- you can get a reservation if you're going to spend more than $40 per person, which is highly probable -- I've never done it but probably should

Favorite dishes / recommendations:
- literally any carpaccio, tartare, tataki, raw fish/meat dish. it's all incredibly good, maybe their specialty?
- sashimi platter
- corn tempura, if you like corn
- buta-kim, if you like tender pork
- frozen cheesecake, if you like Japanese cheesecake (I didn't realize it would be frozen when I ordered but wow, was it good)

But essentially everything on the menu is delicious.

*I wouldn't get chazuke or cartilage unless you know you like them already. It's not a knock on Kiraku's preparation, which is probably fantastic, but ordering chazuke just seems like... opportunity cost given that you could get another carpaccio dish instead of tea, rice, and toppings. As for cartilage, the texture was really, um, off-putting to my Western palate.

Hands down my favorite izakaya in the Bay Area. Sometimes I dream about this place. It's that good.",5.0

I didn't order it though cause I was worried that I won't get to try all the wonderful tapas. T.T I'll be back!!

A little disappointed that the place is now so loud and no longer has the bar atmosphere. (More like a restaurant atmosphere now) Might also be because we went on a Friday night.",4.0
2014,"Food is awesome but this place will make you wait like no other.

As far as food goes, I was extremely satisfied with their lotus chips, their roasted duck dish, their tofu dish, and their Garlic lemon grilled salmon! Their lotus chips were so crisp and addictive. The duck was most and flavorful. Their tofu dish was a nice light but flavorful addition to the meal. And I liked how they served mushrooms with the salmon, that was a plus. The pork belly skewers weren't very impressive compared to everything else. Kind of boring to be honest, the best part was the sauce that came with it because that had a kick to it.

I wish I tried the tempura corn dish that I saw around at other tables but I was so full after all the little dishes. I've also never had bone marrow  or mountain yam so next time I will order those first!

Tips: Get their early or a random time or make a reservation. Otherwise be prepared to wait for at least 45 minutes. I waited over an hour. This place is small, there isn't really a waiting area except for a few chairs, not a place for big groups, you need to get here at a good time or you will wait forever.

Wait is worth it but be prepared.",4.0

I've been here three times and absolutely love the beef tataki, corn tempura, seared albacore sashimi, any type of sashimi really, grilled tuna cheek, grilled beef tongue, and pork belly skewer! The wait tends to be long, so make a reservation in advance (minimum order of $40/person).",5.0
2013,"Decently priced izakaya! There are lots of items on the menu but they are simple. That doesn't make narrowing down your selection any easier, but at least there is a good variety to choose from. The place wasn't packed on a Wednesday night but they wouldn't seat us even though there were open tables for 2. There was a party of 3 before us, so they needed a 4 seater. Seating us at the open tables wouldn't have interfered with them, so I was very confused. Alas, we were eventually seated after 10 minutes of waiting.

The servers were friendly and the food came out fast. I enjoyed the chicken cartilage, pork stew, and skewers (pork belly and beef tongue) but my very favorite dish was the roasted bone marrow with crispy garlic. It literally melted in my mouth and was so buttery and flavorful... I just wanted more and more. Sadly, there is only so much marrow in the bone aaaaand I had to share with my boyfriend.

The happy hour specials only applies to beers and not food :( I'm glad we gave Kiraku a try and I look forward to returning to sample their other dishes.",4.0
2016,"I have always passed by this place in the way home and finally had the chance to come here. It gives off that authentic ramen shop vibe that I seen in anime's like naruto: small, festive and cultured.

When coming here, do not expect a sushi restaurant. Its a tapas style restaurany and should receive those expectations. The wait took 25 mins on Friday, so give or take for the other days.

Food: the Wagyu Beef literally melts in your mouth and is worth trying. I would rate it 10/10; the Corn Tempura is delicious twist to the typical tempura ; the Jumbo Squid was cooked to perfection and sauced conservatively

Pricing: Expect to pay if you eat to youre full but please mind that this is a tapas restaurant. I would offer this place a five stars but I felt like the hype is for the star items rather than the whole menu.",4.0

2015,"I have to say Kiraku is in our top 3 restaurants we love to go to along with Commis in Oakland and Kusakabe in San Francisco.  My only complaint is that I order way too many dishes because they are all so delicious and then I eat them all and go home too stuffed but so happy!

The menu is quite large for such a small restaurant.  Sadly, they have so many specials of the day which we just have to try that lately we rarely get to order my favorites from their regular menu of which there are many!

We tend to order mostly fish dishes because the quality of their fish is so high, so fresh!  You cannot go wrong with any of their offerings.  It seems every visit I have another new dish I adore.  Oh to have one of their fish carpaccio dishes in front of me now!  The different sauces/marinades are perfection.  The chef just knows what flavors to put together!  He is just one of those rare chefs that intuitively knows how to create a perfect dish which BTW is always so beautiful.

Do not hesitate to order their sashimi.  It is always top quality.  Their scallops are so sweet I would not be surprised if they get them in live in the shell.  

I have to mention their tongue dishes too!  A favorite from their regular menu.  Also all their duck dishes are perfect.  And of course all the beef ones also are so enjoyable.  I can honestly say we have never had a dish we did not love.

Beware, I am not the only one that holds Kiraku in such high regard.  Last night we got there at 5:30 and there was already a crowd forming.  The restaurant was full soon after opening.  And even though there was such a crowd all at once, the kitchen managed to get the food out so quickly and cooked so perfectly; a feat onto itself.",5.0

2015,"Kiraku is known for their izakaya. We came here on a Friday night and had to wait roughly an hour before we were seated. Plenty of street parking available. Small restaurant. Can be crowded and loud.

FOOD-
CORN TEMPURA - Favorite dish of the night. Wasn't too heavy nor greasy. Crispy and crunchy on the outside. Green tea salt complemented perfectly. Would definitely order this again!

JUMBO SQUID - Big portion. Perfectly grilled. Very tasty. Wasn't too chewy.

WAGYU BEEF TATAKI - Thin slices of beef. Pretty tasty, but not too filling.

FOIE GRAS DAIKON - Wish there was more foie gras to it. A bit rich from the sauce. Interesting combination with the daikon.

ROASTED DUCK KIRAKU STYLE - Not the best I've had. I was pretty disappointed. Sliced thin and served on a long plate. Wasn't very juicy nor tender. Tasted pretty bland.

CHICKEN CARTILAGE - Tasted like chicken kaarage. Very crunchy and not too oily. We ordered this dish just because we were still very hungry aside from the other dishes we had already ordered.

ROASTED TEA BLANC-MANGER - Subtle tea flavor. A bit sweet and creamy. A much better dessert compared to the green tea ice cream.

GREEN TEA ICE CREAM WITH WARABI MOCHI - Nothing special about it. Was expecting the warabi mochi to be amazing, but nope. I'd pass on getting this dessert.

Service was just OK that day. The food did take awhile to come out. I don't think I'll be back just because Kiraku didn't wow/amaze me. Prices are a bit more expensive for the portion size. The only items worth the trip to Kiraku would be the Corn Tempura and the Jumbo Squid. Otherwise, I wouldn't purposely make a trip to Berkeley for it.",3.0

2015,"CORN TEMPURA AND BEEF TONGUE OMG

FOOD
-Corn Tempura: HOW IS THIS SO GOOD OMG. I love corn to begin with but I totally didn't understand why everyone ewas saying how great this item is. But it's seriously THAT great! It's fried to perfection, super crispy and crunchy on the outside and you can really taste the individual corn kernels in your mouth. The green tea salt really ties it all together because it gives the tempura that saltiness and it really pulls out how fresh the corn is. My bf and I could totally do one order for each one of us so we don't have to share them lol.
-Beef Tongue BBQ Skewers: OMG THIS JUST MELTED IN MY MOUTH. I was a bit freaked out to try beef tongue just because the idea of it sounds so gross but hell yeah am I glad I did. The bbq sauce was perfect over top because it gave it that saltiness to really pair with the beef tongue. The sesame seeds gave it a slight nutty taste and the green onions pulled everything together with a breath of freshness. I could keep eating this for days. It's THAT good.
-Roast Duck: This followed right after the beef tongue and maybe because the beef tongue was so good, it outshined this dish. The meat I felt wasn't super tender and moist and it definitly was not melt in your mouth like the beef tongue. To be honest, my bf and I got a bit bored of it when we got to eating about 4 pieces each..and there was still quite a bit more on the plate. Made us think maybe we should've gone for the beef tongue plate as well instead of the roast duck.
-Sashimi: Super super fresh. Could easily tell it's high quality fish right here.
-Grilled whole squid with teriyaki sauce: wow it was grilled to the point where the teriyaki sauce was all soaked into the squid, yet the squid was still nice, tender and chewable, didn't have to pull at it or anything. The grill taste really shines through in this dish as well.

SERVICE
Our waiter was really friendly and gave a lot of suggestions on what we could order at the beginning. He was relaly willing to walk through the menu with us. However, the service basically went away after we ordered. Not much checking up, hard to get their attention too...(-1/2 star)

SEATING
Wasn't a fan of how closely we were sitting to the next table. Felt like I was squished in and didn't have much breathing room. (-1/2 star)

OVERALL
I will definitely be back. The prices are a lot more reasonable than Ippuku and I left feeling full rather than still hungry like Ippuku haha. The CORN TEMPURA and BEEF TONGUE SKEWERS are to DIE for. Will definitely order them again! Can't wait for my next visit here.",4.0

2013,"Wow Kiraku is fantastic! The corn tempura lived up to the hype. The skewers were great.

My favorite still has got to be the beef tataki. It's quite pricy (rightfully so, it was good quality beef) but it was out of this world delicious.

The food came out fairly slowly, but it was fine since I knew everything was being freshly prepared.

The one thing I would suggest is more meat on the Buta Kim. I'm sure the kimchi was good (I can't really tell good kimchi from bad) but there simply wasn't enough meat to make it worth it. Personally I think the Buta Kim was the most overrated dish.

2016,"Standout izakaya in Berkeley.

First of all: reservation or not, you'll probably have to wait for a table. The space is small, and usually packed with Berkeley locals and college students (who have great taste in food). Parking is street and residential and can be difficult. So before coming here, be wary of all of this and arrive early for dinner (before the crowd). I made a reservation, and I still didn't get a table, even though I arrived with my s.o. in a timely manner. I must have waited at least 45 minutes, with a reservation, and I was a bit annoyed that someone without a reservation was still seated before me.

That being said, I wasn't expecting to enjoy my dining experience here as much as I did. Aside from the reservation system not being too ideal, the service was great, and my waitress was very apologetic for the wait. She even hooked us up with free Coedo beers, which was very nice of her. The food was definitely worth all the trouble of getting there and waiting.

At any izakaya joint, you know I'm all about the Agedashi tofu, and their soft and silky house tofu did not disappoint. Some other things we ordered:

Beef tongue with truffle oil: It was a tad salty, but still one of my favorite things on the menu. Perfect amount of truffle flavor.

Sauteed squid with broccolini: Great texture and flavor. Broccolini was nice and crisp.

Mini Kaisen Donburi: Super cute little bowl with salmon, uni, snow crab, and ikura. Really fresh.

Pork belly skewers: Can't go wrong here.  Pork belly was like butter in my mouth. And what's a trip to an izakaya without some pork belly?

We also got a 3-piece omakase, which was great. I didn't try the infamous corn tempura or any of their desserts, like the sweet potato creme brûlé, or the grapefruit yogurt ice cream. They looked quite tasty though, and that's on my list for next time.

The bill was actually very reasonable for the amount and quality of food we ordered, and the space was actually very intimate (albeit, loud), for a nice sit-down dinner date. Though, admittedly, some of the items are priced a bit steeply. The donburi, in particular, was a bit expensive for the small size. Other than that, this was one of my favorite Bay area meals by far, I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area.",4.0
2013,"I finally finished a meal here with their shoyu ramen.

2015,"Kiraku is, in a word, amazing.

The food is mind blowing, the presentation phenomenal, the service fantastic. I really can't say a bad thing about Kiraku at all. Everytime I've been here I've had really fantastic meals. The only downside for me would definitely be the crowd and the occasionally slow service but really none of that detracts from the amazingness that is Kiraku.

I have never ordered a bad dish here, but here are some particularly memorable dishes:

1. Aburi Chashuu
Delicious! The meat was so tender and flavorful, but didn't at all feel oily and overwhelming. I have never had anything like this.

2. Beef Tongue With Truffle Salt
One of my must haves whenever I come to Kiraku - the beef tongue is always cooked to perfection, soft but with a nice bite to it and so delicate and flavorful.

3. Beef Tataki
Must have! It is so refreshing in the middle of the meal, the citrus really jumps right out at you and it is delightful.

4. Sashimi platter
So fresh and delicious, I can't even. Everything was fantastic but the scallops were pillowy soft and the Hamachi was just to die for. Will be thinking about those scallops for a long time...

5. Miso Nashi
May not be to everyone's liking but I enjoyed this dish immensely. If you are a fan of eggplant you will really like the way it is cooked in this dish. Very yummy and innovative.

6. Crème Brulee
Don't ask just order.

2015,"Hubby brought me here for my birthday celebration.  Love that we could make a reservation even for a small party.  Good service and always packed.  Despite the crowd, it wasn't too noisy inside.  Dishes come one after another on a timely manner.  We tried:
-summer beer: strong taste in wheat, not enough calpico for me
-sake sampling: ok, they do have lots of choices
-Yuca spoon (tofu skin at the bottom, covered with ikura and uni): I tasted the tofu skin but not the uni
-homemade tofu: $6, not smooth enough but understandable as it's handmade, good soy bean flavor
-beef tataki: tender with lots of sauce, good
-lamb chop: sweet and softly grilled, very fresh salad that comes with it including the eggplant
-yuzu capaccio: great yuzu sauce, fresh fish
-fatty toro: ok, somehow the cut made the pieces falling apart, wish it was more oily like the ones we ate in Japan
-foie gras with daikon: can't go wrong with foie gras, overall a sweet dish
-maze udon (salmon rice with ikura): I don't like the mint leaves inside, otherwise, a good dish
-Canadian black pork with egg: salty but very tender pork belly, good onsen egg too
-roasted tea blanc manger dessert: sweet tea pudding, light and refreshing

Overall we are happy as the menu has lots of choices and interesting creations.  The place was well managed despite the full house.  There's always a line outside and wait can be long as each table almost took 1.5 hour to finish their meal.  The reservation requires each person to consume $30 worth of food and also alcohol, not too hard to achieve actually, so it's worth recommending to make a reservation.  Keep in mind though that the seating's only for 5:30 and 7pm, so don't expect to be too flexible.",4.0
2015,"To be honest, I really only decided to come to Kiraku because Ippuku (Berkeley's other izakaya place) was full, but I'm glad I came here instead.  Unlike Ippuku, which is often crowded, loud, and very dark, Kiraku had an endurable wait time and its smaller but more open space layout was a nice change.  

And you know what else Kiraku has that other izakaya places don't have? CORN TEMPURA.  Kiraku's corn tempura is the bom dot com.  Even if you have to pay 7 bucks for two pieces of corn fried in batter, do it anyways because your stomach will thank you.  It sounds really simple (and it is), but really it's just something you need to get if you come here.

One thing about this place though is that it's on the pricey side.  I would not recommend bringing people here if they just want to fill their stomachs.  It'll take at least $25 to fill you up here.  Come with people who love food and want to try new things!",5.0

2012,"Amazingggg. This was my first time going to an izakaya-type restaurant, and it was an awesome experience! The restaurant is very small and intimate-looking, which also means you should plan to come early as it gets full very fast.

Their menu is very extensive, with an assortment of fresh, fried, grilled, and seafood goodies. I came on a dinner date, and we ordered the Lotus Chips, Corn Tempura, Chicken Karaage, Roast Duck, and Teriyaki Squid. In hindsight, we ordered a lot of fried food that ended up feeling very heavy towards the end of the meal (Would have been better with a larger group). But it was so good we finished it all anyways.

The presentation here is amazing!The lotus chips were basically like potato chips, and they looked fun and were fun to eat! The squid was literally a whole squid cut into pieces, and the corn tempura were like little fried cakes of corn kernels. But the 2 stand-out dishes were definitely the Chicken Karaage and Roast Duck. The chicken, though fried, was unbelievably moist and flavorful on the inside. And the roast duck was cooked slightly rare and sliced, but you could still taste the crispy skin on each slice.

And for dessert, we got the roasted tea blanc-manger. Which is basically like a custard that was roast tea flavored and topped with a yummy red bean paste! Also super cute presentation and so much fun to eat!

Finally, their service was great! Always refilled our water, and took away our empty plates. And with the extensive menu, I can't wait to come back and try more! Note that there's also a $12 min per person.",5.0

It would have been nice to have made a reservation, but that requires spending $30/person and buying drinks. Luckily, the wait was totally worth it and the food came out speedily.

What we shared:
Fried stingray fin (4/5) - Yummy! Kinda like a more fibrous, less chewy squid. If that makes any sense.
Corn tempura with green sea salt (5/5) - A must get!! Somehow you don't feel so unhealthy eating this. Crunchy, juicy, and wonderfully seasoned.
Albacore tataki (5/5) - Hecka fresh and the dressing was really light and refreshing.
Grilled pork belly skewers (4/5) -  Quite oily but gotta love pork belly.
Chicken cartilage (3/5) - A large portion! But too crunchy for my liking. But then again I'm not sure what else I was expecting from cartilage heh.
Beef tongue (3/5) - Not bad, but so so oily.
Grilled duck breast (5/5) - Another must get! So tender and flavorful. MAGICAL.

2016,"Over rated.

Food was decent enough but not good enough for the prices charged.

DONT GET ANY SUSHI... I'm admit I am a sushi snob, but they served a 35$ 5 piece sashimi special that was clearly just old fish. Not the worst, but I'm just saying stick to the grilled and fried things. Textures were all wrong on the various fish too, indicating their age and mishandling.

Best dish for me was the fried chicken cartilage ""nankotsu karaage""

Service was pretty bad too. Sent back a sake but they didn't remove it from the bill. They try to get a Japanese thing going with the whole ""irashaimasen"" but they fall short so should probably just give it up. Overall the servers seemed pretty stressed and untalented... Which is no bueno :(

All in all I'd say this place lacks the passion it needs to be awesome. Decor is good btw, so decent for dates, but it is in a sketchy part of telegraph, so keep that in mind.

2017,"I agree with the other negative reviews.

The sashimi was just ok, everything else was subpar.

The food quality has gone down. We were disappointed that we had spent $110 dollars and of that $34 was for average quality and small portion of sashimi. The karage was way too salty
and tasted like it had been microwaved. It was chewy and way TOO hot. Chicken can't be that hot and chewy unless you microwave it.

Oh and the food took forever to get served to us.

The reason why we had gone often in the past 2 years is because it was very fresh on authentic Japanese food. But recently I don't think it is any different for all the rest of the Japanese restaurants in the East Bay.

It seems that they are just too busy and don't seem to care about the quality of their food anymore. I suppose they just make their profits from the sake which the customers seem to enjoy.

Another issue with Kiraku are the tables. Some couples who don't order any alcohol get a 4 top while others who want to spend money and have a reservation get wedged into a 2 top.
It doesn't seem like they care about seating because they are popular.

If they served good quality food and better services, we (2 people) could have spent more than $110 we spent that night (usually, we spend around $150+)
However, we just decided to leave early even though we were still hungry.

Overall, the quality of the food and the service was poor.",2.0
2016,"This review is long overdue. Been going here for years and have loved it each and every single time. One of my top favorite places I hold very dear to my heart.

I have yet to try so many other things on the menu, but my top favorites are:

Corn Tempura (omg so good and perfect)
Beef Tataki (make sure to place a pinch of that green and garlic puree w/each beef slice)
Sashimi (so fresh!)
Roasted Duck
and anything w/Uni

Their seafood is so fresh, you can tell just by looking at it and you'll be a believer when you taste it.

Staff is fast and friendly. The restaurant is small, but it feels and looks cool. Even their restroom is kinda cool lol.

Keep in mind that you have to agree to drink alcohol if you want to make a reservation; otherwise, I would advise to come 30 minutes before they open and sign your name on the waiting list right away, or else you'll be waiting at least an hour and it gets worse the later you come.

I think the only complaint I have is that I wish they had a bigger restaurant and for customers to be able to make reservations w/o having to drink.

2016,"-food: love the beef tongue and the carpaccio, the meat was so fresh and tender and delicate!! The sale was also great, especially the light ones with floral and fruits scent. The mini kaisen donburi was disappointing for me, too salty. The jumbo squid was also tender and fresh, but was expecting it to be warmer. The corn tempura was nothing special compared to tempura I ate in China and Japan, but fresh indeed.
Overall really nice food. Especially compared with other Japanese restaurants in Berkeley. (I think Berkeley do have many delicious Asian restaurants but Japanese restaurants are really plain. The choice of sushi rice is so important)
-service: quick in serving of food. But have to wait a long time before getting seat. Understandable.

Coming here for the second time.
-grilled beef tongue: compared with the tender stewed beef tongue, this one is bigger in portion, but the texture of the meat is not as soft and juicy. I still prefer the tender one.
-Buta-Kim: a friend of mine recommended this to me. At first I thought it was nothing special but a more Korean like flavor of kimchi, but I have to acknowledge that the pork in this dish was super delicious!! Although there are only about 5slices in one plate? But I wanted to eat more!!
-Their ""don""s won't be a disappointing choice for you. Both the oyako-don and the rock-shrimp-ten-don is good.  I also like the yuzu chicken udon, especially its soup, but my friend thinks the udon itself is a little bit salty, so it depends on different people.
-we ordered one of today's special: tuna hamachi kama(?) which is very big. It's skin is too salty, but inside was nice.
-dessert: I really recommend their roasted tea blanc manger, which combines caramel, cream and red bean really well! Also their home-made grapefruit ice cream is really fresh that all of our friends said we wanted to have more. The yuzu mochis are plain and nothing special, not recommended.
-Sake: I tried the lychee sake, peach sake and yuzu citrus sake, all are very delicious, while the lychee sake has the strongest flavor, and the citrus sake is the freshest. The peach sake is sweet. I love them solo much!!! The waitress said that they could be bought in Richmond!!

2014,"Kiraku is a very good (and small) izakaya not too far from the Berkeley campus.
We made reservations for when they opened, and arrived a little early. There are only a handful of tables squished next to each other. For about the first 45 minutes, the place remained relatively empty, making us feel like we didn't need a reservation. However, by the time we left, the place was full with some waiting at the door.
When you make a reservation, there's an FYI on their website that says:

""We request that guests with reservations drink alcoholic beverages and order a minimum of $30 per person.""

Which we thought was a little demanding, but we ended up exceeding the minimum easily. We also ordered a beer an a Calpico chu-hai, one of the soju mixed drinks. The chu-hai was too strong, and not very good. I feel like they wouldn't hold you to that request, though. Nothing was ever mentioned or suggested.

The star of dthe night was the Corn Tempura with the green tea salt. Next time we'll order two plates. The crunch was totally different and interesting, and it was just so addicting. Definitely an experience for the mouth.
The sashimi combo was very fresh, and the grilled duck was nicely cooked.

The beef tongue was ok, if I remember correctly it had too much truffle oil drizzled on top which was a turn off. We ordered the Butakim as our last dish after we had finished with the other entrees. It sounded way better on paper than when we had it. It was partially due to us being full already, and the pork was very fatty and the dish was too greasy to have at the end of the meal. We couldn't finish it, sadly.

We had the roasted tea blanc mange for dessert. It was pretty good, super mild and refreshing.

We ordered an assortment of things including ramen, hotaruika, corn tempura, renkon, age taro, karaage, buta kim, takowasa, karasumi and onigiri.

For the most part, everything was fine and executed properly. I found the corn tempura to hold its shape well and the corn offered a subtle sweetness to the dish. Only down side was, it was on the saltier side and made it hard to enjoy it fully. Everything else was straight forward but lacked anything exciting. No dish made me want to go back for more.

Service was fair but it did take some time to get our onigiri. They offered us a free side dish to compensate us for the time. While the free appetizer was a nice touch, I did not care for it and glad we didn't order it on our own. It was a medley of root vegetables.

The place was charming, the food was creatively delicious without being too edgy, the portions were fair, and the service was great (I tipped 25-30% every time I go). I would go here for special occasions such as dates, birthdays, or to treat myself.

However, I vowed to never return after one sour incident. I wanted to make a reservation for my birthday, so I called to see if I could book a slot. The girl who picked up my call informed me that the minimum order for reservation is $40 per person. Hmmm I thought...it used to be $30, then $35, now it's $40. And on top of that, she said, we would have to order drinks, so realistically it was $50 per person. Ok, that's fine.

So then, she also told me that reservation meal is now pre-fixed only, meaning that the $40 would pay only for a menu that the chef has planned for us and we would be able to order the a la carte menu separately. That's fine.

But then I asked her approximately how many dishes would be in the pre-fix as I wanted to explain to my guess how much $40 worth of food would be. It was very apparent that the girl on the phone was very confused by my question and  rudely said ""sir, we only take reservation for people who are familiar with OUR restaurant's style of food . To which I said ""well, I am very familiar with ikazaya & have actually have been a regular customer for 3 years"" & said my goodbye.

2016,"Well, well, well...how to put my Kiraku experience into words?

In short, it was simply amazing. I dined with one of my best foodie friends, which was the perfect size for such a small and crowded space, about two years ago and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday.

Kiraku is the place to go if you want to let your foodie freak flag fly (tongue twister anyone?) and have some dollars to spend, and we did just that.

First and foremost, this place is not cheap. Tapas never are, at least outside of Spain they're not. Combined with an Asian fusion concept and small portions? It's a death sentence on your wallet. However, bearing those things in mind, come expecting to shed some pounds (heh, get it?) and you will have an amazing experience and great time!

Rule of thumb: order one of everything that sounds good to you. Because why not? It's why you're here, isn't it? As for us, we ordered one each of the bone marrow, rock shrimp, tempura corn (with green tea salt sprinkled on top, mind you) and chicken karaage just to name a few. While the portions are small (again, they're tapas), after you get in the habit of ordering a few, they really add up, both in dollars and real estate in your tummy. Try to save room for dessert!

While I feel like my review is not doing Kiraku justice at all, just know that a dining experience here is truly unique. Even if you have had Japanese tapas before, the dishes here are one of a kind and I haven't seen them done anywhere else. I mean, green tea salt?! Who thinks of these things!? The menu seems to change occasionally and their strength is the creative and innovative qualities of their dishes.

Do yourself a favor and let your foodie freak flag fly! Stop reading about other people's experiences here because they probably will not be the same as yours. Put down the phone and go try it for yourself. This is probably one of the few times I will end a review in such brevity but trust me, you won't regret it :)",4.0
2014,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I made the fatal mistake of not making a reservation. And it all went downhill from there....

We arrived at 8:30 pm on a Thursday night, thinking that a random weekday late-ish dinner time would be enough to avoid making a reservation, which requires a $30 per person minimum (a little steep for grad students looking for a small bite). We saw the place was tiny and packed but there were only 2 parties on the wait list: a party of 1 and a party of 2. It was then that I turned to my boyfriend, and spoke the most foolish and naive words to ever be uttered within the 100 square feet that comprise Kiraku's entire restaurant space: ""How long could it possibly take for so few people to be seated?"" With that, in a moment I will forever reflect on with deep regret, I scrawled my name in the third spot on the wait list, and unknowingly signed away my soul to 1.5 hours of torment in the special hell known as the Kiraku wait list.

Yes, we waited for 1 HOUR AND A HALF.  We should have left, I know. But we went a few doors down, grabbed a beer, came back, shopped at Buffalo Exchange, came back, and before we knew it, it was 9:45 pm, we were starving, and most other restaurants were closing soon. We were committed.

Finally, I asked the waitress how the wait could possibly be this outrageous.  She explained to us that we weren't getting seated because people who had made reservations kept arriving. If they knew all along that they had so many reservations coming in, and they saw us sitting there for so long, it would have been much appreciated if they told us right away that they simply could not accommodate us that night and we could have left and ate elsewhere. Instead, they kept reassuring us that we would be seated soon and we waited and waited, which is just poor customer service.

Overall, the food was good, interesting, and cool, but not spectacular. We ordered the appetizer sampler, with Takowasabi (wasabi octopus), Spicy Jellyfish, and Seaweed. The Spicy Jellyfish and Seaweed were tasty, but I would not recommend the wasabi octopus. It was too heavily flavored with wasabi, and tasted like there was more wasabi than octopus, rather than octopus with a hint of wasabi like we expected. We also got the Corn Tempura, which tasted like funnel cake...yum.. and the Jumbo Squid, which was a little on the salty side but pretty good. We did not spend anywhere near $30/person and we were content with the amount we ate. We weren't stuffed though.

To conclude, I think that their food is unique and fun to try but not really all that it is cracked out to be.  They stay busy because their space is SO small that it simply cannot accommodate the amount of customers they have (maybe upgrade to a larger location?). Last, but certainly not least, if you want to avoid the scenario that compelled me to write this dissatisfied review, go make a freakin' reservation.",3.0
2016,"Kiraku is incredible. I've only been here a few times, but it's also worth the money and wait. The food is delicious, especially all the fish dishes. I'm not even sure what dish is my favorite... It's all so good. The flavors blend together so well.

The space itself is quite small, so if you don't have a reservation and aren't the first few tables in line, you'll have a while to wait. I promise it's worth it though!",5.0
2017,"Delicious and the staff was warm and attentive.  BUT, Yelp shouldn't call this a sushi restaurant because it isn't one.",5.0
2014,"I have now been to Kiraku twice and have mixed feelings about this restaurant. On both occasions, I have had problems but I really really wanted to like this place. I recommend you to come off hours as the wait can get very long, especially if you have a large group. On Friday nights and on the weekend, the wait can get as long as an hour for a group of 3.

The first time I went to Kiraku, we ordered the jumbo squid, black cod, sashimi special of the day (it ended up being hamachi), beef tongue skewer, clam skewer, chicken cartilage, and the donburi special (salmon roe, uni, and sake [salmon] with rice).

The second time I went to Kiraku, we ordered the sashimi special (amber jack, red snapper, and scallops), jumbo squid, grilled beef tongue, and the salted hamachi kama.

Stand out dishes:

Sashimi special - I have always loved the sashimi here. I think it is VERY fresh. However, the portions are quite small, and on average, market price for each sashimi piece was around $2-3 per piece.

Grilled beef tongue - Very tender, well seasoned, and absolutely delicious. The beef wasn't dry, which is something I worry about with grilled meat.

Black cod - Very very good. Our cod was perfectly cooked and had a great sauce. It's not very large but it tastes fantastic.

Problems:

After my first visit to Kiraku, I was hit with a really bad bout of food poisoning. It kept me up all night, and I honestly have no idea what I ate (I suspect either the cartilage or the donburi) that caused such a bad reaction. On my second visit to Kiraku, I did not experience food poisoning. However, our waitress made several mistakes throughout our dining experience. On the first occasion, we ordered 4 pieces of sashimi for each fish in the sashimi special. However, when we received our meal, they only gave us 3 pieces each and we had to wait an extra ten minutes for the rest. Furthermore, when our waitress gave us the bill at the end of our meal, they charged us for an item we never ordered (which we almost did not catch because our entire receipt was in Japanese).

That being said, I have had some great dishes at Kiraku but I don't think that every dish at Kiraku is fantastic and worth the price. Eating here can get very expensive very quickly so make sure to order the dishes that are well recommended!

4 stars for food but 1 star docked for service.",3.0
2014,"We came here a few weeks ago on a Friday night at 9:30pm and there was still a half hour wait!! Wow, this place is popular! The restaurant is small and only seats about 25-30 people. There was a large group celebrating someone's birthday that night, so it took longer to get a table.

Ordered:
- yuba :: homemade tofu skin topped with ikura, uni, green onion, and sesame seeds
- suzuki carpaccio :: striped bass, yuzu citrus, chives, ginger, sesame oil, shichimi spice
- sashimi :: toro, kanpachi (amberjack), kurodai (black snapper), mahata (grouper)
- roasted duck kiraku style
- buta-kim :: sautéed pork and kimchi with poached egg
- mini kaisen-donburi :: salmon, ikura, uni, snow crab over rice
- sweet potato creme brulée
- roasted blanc manger :: hojicha pudding!!

Looking at the menu, we wanted to order everything here... and we almost did!! :P We ordered a lot of food for just two people! Everything that we ordered was delicious! I just wished our table was bigger to fit all the food we had ordered! lol :D Every dish was unique and excellent, but my absolute favorite was the mini kaisen-donburi!

We originally came here because we read an article mentioning about their ramen. sanfrancisco.travel/loca… We looked through people's food photos on yelp and looked around the restaurant. We didn't see anyone order ramen. Well that evening, we ordered everything BUT ramen! haha

We'll definitely be back for more! And maybe try their ramen next time! :)

Tips:
- the dishes add up! expect to pay around $100 or more for 2ppl!
- there's always a wait, so get there early!
- come with a big group (4-6ppl) or come with a big appetite so you can order everything! :)
- parking: lots of metered street parking and residential parking",5.0
2018,"Overpriced for a lot of the food. Some of it is amazing. The beef carpaccio is so good. Some food is like, ""why did we spend $20 on the weirdest tasting dish I've ever tried?"" Im talking to you, crab bisque. Be prepared to spend +$80 to not feel satisfied.",3.0
2016,"I was hesitant to write a review for Kiraku because frankly, I don't want to share this gem with anyone else. Haha.

This place is hands down my favorite restaurant to have dinner in Berkeley. Be warned, this place is popular and it is tiny! Unless you have made a reservation or you get there when they open, be prepared for a wait!

Atmosphere: As stated above, this place is cozy and can get a bit loud at times. Its casual, nicely decorated and has a ""family run"" feel to it. The servers are all really friendly and attentive.

Food: I have come here many times and have never been disappointed. A few favorites are:

- Karasumi
- Corn tempura
- Karaage
- Garlic Edamame
- Steamed Clams
- Hamachi Kama
- Kimchi with pork belly
- Pork Belly Skewer
- Black Cod Skewer
- Sweet Potato Brulee

They also have specials that are always a must try!

The beers here are also amazing! They foam them perfectly every time!",5.0
2012,"I think this place deserves a 3.5, but I'm rounding them down. The 4.5 average on Yelp is very generous, in my opinion.

In order to make a reservation, you have to agree to spend at least $30 per person OR agree to drink a lot of alcohol. Even if you don't have a reservation, there is a minimum dollar amount per person, either $12 or $15. I feel like that alcohol requirement might be violative of some law, but whatever.

Boyfriend picked out this place and I was excited to see a crowded restaurant with lots of Japanese-speaking people both working and dining. Good sign, right? I don't know, maybe we ordered the wrong things because I wasn't impressed by the food.  We ordered:

Boiled Chilean sea bass ($7) (2/5): Chilean sea bass is one of my favorite types of fish to fish to eat but this dish was somehow flavorless to me, even with the ponzu sauce and onions. Definitely skip this.

Organic chicken karaage ($8) (3.5/5): Decent chicken karaage. Boyfriend is a big fan of this stuff in general and polished off the plate. I thought it was too salty.

Corn tempura with green tea salt ($7) (5/5): This was our favorite dish of the night. I don't know if this is a typical izakaya offering because we've never seen it elsewhere. It didn't feel overly oily or heavy, and the amount of batter was perfect.

Roasted duck with foie gras ($24, on the special menu) (3/5): I had really high hopes for this dish after reading some of the previous yelp reviews. The entire dish is served  at room temperature, which put me off, and I was hoping for crispier duck skin. The last two times I had foie gras (Gary Danko and Keiko A Nob Hill) the foie literally overwhelmed me with richness and flavor, and here at Kiraku it lacked that ""WOW"" factor.

The pacing of the meal was off, and I think they tried to ameliorate that by giving us free seaweed salad with our dish that came after the long wait. They should have provided that during the 20 minutes between course two and course three. Aside from that, the service was great.

Cost of these four dishes, a sake flight and a glass of asahi super dry draft came to $66 before tip.

I'd be willing to try this place out again, but I'd only reorder the corn tempura. Everything else was lackluster.",3.0
2014,"Izakaya in the style of Gochi in South Bay, but a bit more traditional. Long line of people waiting for hours, so I'm glad we snagged a reservation.

***FATTY TUNA & BABY YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI

Not the least bit fishy, which can be a difficult task for sashimi. The baby yellowtail was beautifully glassy and smooth. The fatty tuna was a soft pink and quite literally melted into nothingness in my mouth, just how I like it. This is some of the better sashimi I've had in the Bay Area.

***CORN TEMPURA W/ GREEN TEA SALT

Kinda fun, nice fragrant oily crunch, sweet corn. Green tea salt sounds cute, but the flavor was basically invisible. Nothing fancy or gourmet, but a satisfying snack nonetheless.

***GRILLED BLACK PORK BELLY W/ SPICY MISO

Skewers of pork belly, fatty & succulent just the way it should be. Nice simple grilled flavor, pleasantly savory miso sauce to dip in. One of the highlights of the meal.

***GRILLED BEEF TONGUE

I was expecting great things here, but found the tongue to be a bit wiry & tough. Very light grilled flavor--not quite salty enough, but the oily ponzu dip had some salted garlic paste that evened the score. This could have been monumental, but it fell short.

***ROASTED DUCK KIRAKU STYLE

Thin slices of tender pink duck lying in a bed of sweet soy sauce & vinegar. Quite nice, but slightly dry and not as fatty as I would expect from our feathered friends.

***FRESH OCTOPUS CARPACCIO FROM HOKKAIDO W/ CRUNCHY PLUM FLAKES

A lovely but boring dish of lightly grilled octopus--this animal is so bland that it really needs a strong grilling to kick some flavor into it. The mayonnaise-y tarter didn't help, but how could it?

***FRESH SCALLOPS FROM HOKKAIDO, JAPAN, GRILLED W/ HOMEMADE PESTO

The idea, presentation, and sauce were a success--the only problem was the texture of the scallop, which should have been buttery and smooth, but instead was a little stringy, almost like crab meat.

***ROASTED TEA BLANC-MANGER

A light Asian dessert, pudding that had the consistency and flavor of tofu (ie not creamy enough). Strong essence of black tea, a little red bean paste on top, a few tapioca pearls, and a small dollop of whipped cream. This was a lot more boring than it sounded. But it was pretty--that counts for something, right?

***HOMEMADE GRAPEFRUIT YOGURT ICE CREAM

We had a little sample of this, and upon tasting it, I wish I'd picked it instead of the blancmange. It was just so refreshing, yogurty with little chunks of grapefruit, pleasantly creamy. A larger portion would have been the perfect final chapter to a savory meal.

2017,"Loved the entire experience. We stopped by here for dinner after an afternoon at the De Young Museum. There was parking just past the restaurant down the side street, and I believe it was free after 5:30 or 6pm. When we got there, no line had yet formed so the two of us slid open the door (yes, just like the sliding screen door style in Japan) and were showed to a table. The place was already full, and cheerfully noisy with conversation. We weren't sure how many tapas to order so we went with the corn tempura, rock shrimp ten-don, two pork belly skewers, omelet salad, and the wagyu beef. The wait staff and kitchen did a great job pacing out the dishes and clearing the finished ones away, which is good because the tables are on the smaller side. For all those dishes without drink or tip was about $40, and we were both pleasantly full. Definitely will go back for the corn tempura, rock shrimp ten-don, and to try the rest of the menu.",5.0

We also ordered shabu-shabu for $44 they was 10 tiny thin pieces of fish and a crazy price.

Yuba (tofu skin w salmon roe and sea urchin): so much flavor in one bite! Yes, you should eat it all in one bite. If you're a fan of either salmon roe or sea urchin, I highly recommend this.

Grilled beef marrow: perfection. We actually ordered this at the end of our meal, when we were already super full. But we savored the flavor to the very last bit!

Chicken karaage: crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.

Corn tempura w green tea salt: we started with this one and it had a nice, subtle saltiness to accompany the natural sweetness of the corn.

Fried chicken cartilage: if you're into chicken cartilage like I am, this was actually one of my favorites of the evening.

Scallop and salmon sashimi: refreshing and big pieces.

Wagyu tataki: a big plate. That marbling was gorgeous!

2014,"We waited for two hours to get seated. Our friends came early to put our names down for a party of 5 and they estimated a one hour wait, but we ended up waiting for two hours. Not the establishment's fault at all, people were just taking more time to finish their meals I guess! With that in mind, this place is quite small so be prepared to wait unless you make a reservation (minimum $30 per person if you make a reservation).

We had:
1. Jumbo Squid - tender and chewy, served with a nice dipping sauce on the side
2. Takowasabi (wasabi octopus) - I loved this. It comes in a tiny bowl (reminiscent of the tea cups you get at Chinese restaraunts) so don't be surprised at the small amount. It is packed with wasabi flavour and the fresh octopus tastes amazing! Highly recommended for wasabi lovers!
3. Beef tongue - comes on a sizzling pan so be careful. Very fresh and chewy just like how beef tongue is supposed to be; not too overcooked or salty.
4. Beef tongue with truffle oil - I loved the texture of this beef tongue much more than the other beef tongue dish. However, the truffle flavour is VERY strong which took away from the quality of this dish for me.
5. Snow crab with brocollini - This is a cold dish. The combination of the fresh crab and slightly cooked brocollini is very refreshing and delicious! Highly recommend this dish.
6. Rocky Shrimp tempura - this dish reminds me of walnut shrimp haha...not sure if that's a good or bad thing. It's good to eat one or two pieces but gets boring after that.
7. Pesto udon - I'm not sure what the original name of this dish was...but the combination of pesto, mushrooms, and fresh octopus (or squid? I'm not quite sure) works surprisingly well. Definitely get this dish if you are looking for more of a 'filler' dish to fill you up for dinner here.
8. Fried rice - We ordered the fried rice with pickled veggies. we ordered this primarily as a filler dish. Tastes pretty good with the pickled vegetables, but nothing too special. It does its job at filling you up if you're not full from the tapas.
9. Agedashi tofu - standard agedashi tofu, tastes pretty authentic
10. Roasted duck - Soft and chewy meat and crispy skin! This dish was one of the best dishes that I had here. It's not too salty but it's seasoned perfectly so that the flavour of the duck comes out, and it's nice and juicy too; not dry at all! I would highly recommend this dish to people who come here for the first time.
11. Suzuki Carpaccio - very fresh fish and it's a nice twist for sashimi lovers. The fish is sliced very thinly and is almost transparent!

It came out to ~37 dollars per person, which is not bad at all for Japanese tapas, especially considering how tasty each dish was.",4.0
2017,"The best Izakaya in the Bay Area. Everything I've tried on their menu is awesome. The owner's attention to detail is unmatched.

2014,"A line start's forming before closing. That's how popular this place is! I can't comment on their main sushi dishes because I came here with a friend and we ordered $25 for just appetizers, then left to go to a Mexican place down the street. This place is pricey! no doubt.

The bacon asparagus appetizer was scrumptious and very well seasoned. It wasn't too heavy like a lot of other places do it. If I'm going to be paying $1 for each bite of bacon asparagus though, I don't expect anything less.

Fish is very fresh, service is exceptional, seating and ambiance is very comfortable. This is a great place to come for a special occasion and/or romantic dinner. The only problem I have with this place is the price, though I can't expect much else with such a hipster area like Berkeley",4.0
2015,"Yes it can be expensive.  But it's soooo goood!!!

Yes there can be a long line to wait in if you don't have a reservation.  So make a reservation but beware of their  $30 per person policy for reservations.

If you are looking for a place to fill up on Japanese food, you may be shocked at the portions and prices.  But isn't that typical of every tapas style restaurant?  My suggestion is to go with the flow - order a glass of draft Asahi and start ordering things you haven't had before one-at-a-time until you are happy, or meet the $30 per person reservation policy or both.

The first time we walked in we were wowed by the atmosphere, staff friendliness and even more so by the menu with its unique offerings.  The chef gets that presentation is nearly as important as taste so they make sure the items going out to your table are tantalizing.

Can't wait to go back!

On this visit we ordered...

(From the Everyday Menu)

Homemade Tofu Appetizer - this is fresh cold tofu and it was soooo good!  With bonito flakes and minced ginger.  Just add some soy sauce from the table and it's a great combo of flavors.  Will get this again for sure.

Albacore Yuzu Ceviche - as good as any ceviche i've ever had.  Citrus salsa ""cooked"" chunks of albacore tuna of course all goes well together and the chips are great quality as well (not crappy store bought).

Grilled Skewered Beef Tongue - grilled fatty meaty tender deliciousness with a citrusy yuzu miso sauce.  This was akin to some really good pork belly.  The fat absolutely melted in the mouth.  Awesome.

Grilled Tatami Iwashi - grilled salty flat sheets of dried tiny sardines.  This is almost like a snack food you'd find in an Asian market - goes very well with beer.  Nice.

(From the Daily Menu - aka specials)

Sautéed Crunchy Squid with Broccolini Anchovy Garlic and Bonito Flakes - garlicky squid chunks with slightly bitter broccolini.  Nice.

Jumbo Anago (Eel) Tempura - never had eel tempura and this didn't disappoint.  Slightly sweet eel with crunchy batter went nicely with the typical tempura sauce with the generous side of daikon+ginger to add.  Very good.

Mini Kaisen-Donburi - this is a tiny chirashi bowl of assorted sashimi over rice.  Nice, but not unique like their other stuff so I will try something else next time.",5.0

Did somebody lie to us in order to empty the table quickly??? If so, this is horrible business mind set!",1.0
2014,"Wow!  A real taste of Japan here in Berkeley!
Kiraku totally captured my heart!!

1) Food - Their food is authentic, yet they use the seasonal ingredients and have the creative touch as well. Everything is just delicious. And, the price is great and not expensive.
Most of the dishes are less than 10 dollars, which is very gently-priced compared to other Izakaya places in the Bay Area.  All the deserts dishes are 6 dollars.
And the portion is bigger than I expected, which is a great surprise. The most of the dishes can be easily shared with 4-5 people.

Amongst dishes I had, especially I liked:

*Snow Crab and Broccolini Dressed with Sea Urchin (daily menu) - My favorite dish of the night.  The broccolini is cooked perfectly Al Dente and it has a nice flavor of ocean.
*Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - Wow! This is so crispy and delicious. Even though it is deep fried, it is very light with the green tea salt, which is just perfectly seasoned.
*Buta-Kim (Sauted Pork and Kimchi w/Poached Egg) - I always like this dish personally and with the poached egg, it adds some special texture and flavor to it.
*Organic Chicken Karaage - Very simple dish, which everyone knows if you like Japanese food.  The contrast of the crispy texture outside between tender and juicy chicken inside was so pleasant.
*Mountain Yam and Ikura (daily menu) - Nicely presented in a Chinese style spoon and it is a great cold appetizer.

2) Drinks - I didn't drink much on the night I went there, but according to the menu, they have the wide variety of drinks including beer, Sake and other liquors.

3) Service - Very attentive and warm.  The first thing they do when we sit down at the table is welcoming us with the fresh wet towel, which is very Japanese style.
The wait staff are so friendly and have the smile on their faces constantly.
We had our dog leashed outside and kept checking on her.  One of the waitresses was excited to see her and she even put some water in front of our dog without telling us.  This is called the ""hospitality"".
The restaurant was packed throughout our dinner, but they did a great job handling all the customers with a great teamwork and flow.

4) Reservation - They take reservations, but they have the minimum charge of $30 per person if you make a reservation.
Personally, I hate to wait in the line, so I recommend you making a reservation, but if most of your party don't drink much, you might not be able to reach $30 each.
Drinkers should have no problem spending $30 there.
We went there on Sunday night, but people were continuously waiting for the tables.

5) Ambience - Very casual typical Izakaya style.  Everyone including kids can enjoy this restaurant.

This is the Izakaya I definitely recommend with confidence and I just wish I could live close by!",5.0
2014,"I came to Kiraku with my friend because we both like Japanese Izakayas, where you get a wide selection of little dishes and deliciously char-grilled but juicy skewered meats of all sorts.

We came here early, like about when they were just opening around 5pm, and good thing we did, because even though it was an early in the week weeknight, it got crowded later with a waiting list.

When I saw others reviewing a Japanese place this close to campus, I figured it was just gushing Cal students with little experience just happy to have some Japanese flavors that were cheap and nearby. But this was not the case at Kiraku. It is the real deal!

Most of the people here were not students, but older, with a little more discerning tastes, including some Japanese.

I had just eaten a couple days earlier at another new Izakaya in San Jose (Misaka Grill near Santana Row) and it was excellent. But I must say, Kiraku matches or perhaps exceeds some others I have been to for Japa Tapas, and I have been to many here and in Japan.

Perhaps like the South Bay Izakayas of Gaku and Ajito, and to some degree Ippuku, also in Berkeley, the staff is all Japanese, even the waitresses are fluent. This gives Kiraku a little different vibe then the we-will-employ-anyone-who-is-Asian-looking places. They understand the service ethic expectation in Japan, and try to keep up with it here.

They have a great selection of all the main categories of dishes you would like to find in an Izakaya, and they have a good election of Sake and Shotchu as well. The dishes are too numerous to describe one by one, so just look at the pictures and see if they look good to you.

This place isn't cheap, and if you go hog wild with your taste buds calling the action, you can exceed $100 for 2 people, so this is definitely not a place for those on a student budget, unless they are on a diet.

Try out Kiraku and let me know what you think.

As for me, I will be coming back.",5.0
2014,"An amazing Izakaya experience just a couple blocks away from the UC Campus.

I was able to make a reservation there for two, which was really nice, since the place is usually packed. In order to make a reservation, you have to guarantee that you will spend at least $30 per person. Not really that hard to do if you're drinking some of their fine quality sakes.

Loved the sake flights. Got the middle tier ""Kiraku"" flight and followed it up with a ""cup"" of a nice diagingo, recommended by the owner. They pour a single cup in the traditional masu, so you're basically getting two servings as they overflow the glass into the small box containing it. I drank from the masu and my date had the glass.

What set this place apart for me was the attention of the staff. We accidentally ordered a rice dish midway through our meal. The server came by to double-check if we meant to do that, since in a traditional izakaya experience you're not supposed to have rice dishes until the end. We told them it was fine, since we're not purists, but that attention to detail and authenticity really set this place apart in my mind.

Food was excellent and wonderfully presented. There is fare there for the mild and the adventurous. This place is definitely better for groups of four or less. More than that and you'll have to wait an awfully long time for a table, come really early, or make one of those coveted reservations.",5.0
2014,"A Japanese place without sushi. Suspicious.

We went here for a friend's birthday, and I regret not saying yes when the waiter asked us if we wanted sake. This place is pretty pricy, and the portions are small. If you're not willing to take out your wallet, or if you were deceived by the ""Japanese"" classification, you might want to find your California Roll elsewhere. We got the corn tempura, squid, and tofu. My favorite was the corn tempura, which was the perfect mix of sweet and fried goodness. Service was good, and our bill came up to around $30 per person. Obviously, the guys weren't full and declared that they were getting pizza afterwards.",4.0
2017,"I recently visited Kiraku with a friend and the place was a little better than expected. Of course, it would have been better if we had gotten there early as well. Gwas a bit of a hassle, as there were very few spots available and the wait for food can be somewhat anti-climactic. If you're going there with an appetite, then be prepared for the wait. We had a few things there, but the one favourite was the pork belly skewers and their beef tataki. Both very different, but they were good. I would also recommend their green tea ice cream if you're in the mood for dessert. Although the food was relatively alright, service could have been better.",3.0
2017,"Be prepared to dish out some dough, but also be prepared to be amazed. Only comparable place around the area is Ippuku, especially the wait. Make reservations so you don't have to wander around Berkeley for 1-2 hrs. What should you get? EVERYTHING. No, seriously you should come here a few times and figure out what your favorite dishes are. The staff is amazing and super attentive. Let them know what they recommend based off of what you like. Also if you're trynna impress your crush I suggest you take them here, not sure if I mentioned this, but MAKE RESERVATIONS.",5.0
2017,A different kind of Japanese food. No sushi rolls. Some sashimi. Lots of care taken to create beautiful and tastey food. I liked 80% of what we ordered. I like the decor. FYI: tables are quite close together.,5.0
2017,This is a really good restaurant and I enjoyed the uni that was topped atop my snow crab and rice dish. It's slightly more expensive for the amount you are given but the skills needed to make the food are greatly appreciated.

2014,"Stopped off in Berkley for food!  Looked up something on Yelp.  I saw this place had 4 1/2 stars after 300+ reviews so my fiancée and I decided to stop off.
This place is small yet packs a bunch of people.  They are open fairly late.

When shown to our table after being seated they brought out warm wash cloths to wash our hands with.

Although small, the place has a new twist on the Japanese decor, modern take on traditional design.

Roasted tea is refreshing and light in flavor.

Corn Tempura with green tea salt phenomenal!  So tasty and delicious!  Hot out of the fryer, and salted perfectly!  No need for a salt shaker at the table.

Black pork belly skewer with homemade spicy miso is tasty, even for me a non pork fan.

Jumbo squid cooked to perfection!  Not too chewy, but you know it's cooked through and through.

Wagyu beef tataki, as Wagyu should be, delicate and tasty like the finest carpaccio!

Mini Kaisen donburi has various bits of sushi, very yummy!!!

Yaki udon with octopus and basil pesto is a very new and unique take on Yaki udon!  Me like!!  The bonito flakes on top sealed the deal to make this a Japanese dish and not Italian!  So good!

Oyako don is so tasty, the good old fashioned chicken rice and egg over rice!  Just as good as everything else!

The bathroom is diminutive in size but pleasant with pictures of their food and empty bottles of sake, very simple aesthetics but nice.  If you are an incredibly large person, you will have difficulty turning.

This place is shockingly good and ingenuity to the dishes are unlike I have seen before!  The service is excellent, never leaving a glass empty and accommodating to the personnel and thanked us for waiting multiple times.

I will definitely return when I am back to Berkley!  I would definitely suggest this place to other people!  Let this place be here til I die!  Sooooooo goood!!!!!  The chef has impressed the hell out of me with his/her creativity!!",5.0
2014,"Hands down one of the BEST Japanese restaurants I've been to! It is so good that it's comparable to the food I've experienced in Japan.

It is not a fancy place by it's look. It is small but cozy and clean, and has that Japanese traditional izakaya feel. Service was extremely friendly and helpful. It is wise to make reservations ahead and they do require you to spend at least $30 per person (you can easily spend that much and it's well worth it). They also have a tight deadline that sometimes they ask you to leave at a certain time to accommodate the next reservation. Again, they are very polite about it, and the timeline is more than enough for us to enjoy our food.

So here comes the best part... their near perfect quality and super delicious food!
Here are some highlights:

Sashimi plate: The sashimi special was consisted of fresh scallops, fatty tuna, black tuna, salmon and some other fish that I can't name. And it doesn't matter because they tasted freaking awesome! It's to die for melt in your mouth pure awesomeness! The pieces may not be huge, but they are worth every penny as you savor every near perfection bite. It is like butter, but only 10 times better.

Snow crab broccoli salad with uni dressing: Hello? it's uni dressing, can it be any more exotic than this? The broccoli is fresh and crisp, crab of course is fresh, and uni dressing on top is the last draw to the great texture and taste combo.

Duck: Forgive my Chinese ignorance, but I believe, and always will believe, that Chinese makes the BEST duck. However, these come pretty close. They are juicy, tasty and fatty (in a very good way). This is how ducks should be cooked and prepared.

Battered fried corn and rice balls: These are the must haves when you visit an izakaya restaurant, and they definitely don't disappoint at Kiraku. I appreciate that they add their own special touch to these standard izakaya dishes.  The seasoning is very tasty and the seaweed salt is perfect on the fried corn. They have their own homemade pickles to go with the rice balls which works very well. The pickles are not the usual Japanese pickles I get in super market or Ramen restaurants, it reminds me of the Chinese sour pickles but it has a Japanese spicy twist to it. The rice balls are grilled nicely so you do get that crunchy on the outside but soft in the inside texture.

Grapefruit sorbet: I believe they made these sorbet themselves. It is fresh and super refreshing. It is creamy without being creamy (if that makes any sense). The grapefruit taste is strong but not overpowering. Every hint of citric taste is just right. Perfect way to end the meal.

Sake: Kiraku has a pretty good sake menu with reasonable pricing. The staff made a few recommendations based on our taste, and we enjoyed the drinks very much. It's easy to drink and we didn't get headaches later. FYI, the one we ordered was called ""Dassai"".

It was an amazing experience at Kiraku with top quality food, enthusiastic and friendly staff, and the cozy casual atmosphere. It is a great place to enjoy authentic Japanese cuisine while catching up with friends over smooth sake. I've been to Japanese restaurants that are three times more expensive but they can't hold a candle to this place. It is restaurants like this make you appreciate Berkeley even more. It is hard to locate these types of gems in most other states.",5.0
2018,"Absolutely amazing service and delicious and fresh food!!! Love their thin sliced fish with hot oil, citrus juice, and pepper powder (forgot the name of the dish...). Downside is cramp seating and long wait, but I assure you the food will be worth your time. The desserts were delicious as well, especially the Black Tea Blanc Mange (see pic below) is soooo smooth and refreshing and satisfying!!! Check out their bathroom too haha, super unique decor.",5.0
2018,"We went to Kiraku on a Saturday night without a reservation, and the wait was 3 hours long, but the food made the wait so so worthwhile...

Corn tempura with matcha salt: So good.  How do they make it so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside?
Garlic edamame: Super savory without being too heavy.  Would definitely recommend
Salmon carpaccio: Probably my favorite dish here, I expected a thinly sliced salmon at first but, to my surprised, got reasonably thick salmon slices (yay) drenched in yummy marinade
Sashimi: We got salmon, tuna, and scallop.  We would have gotten the toro if we could, but toro apparently only comes in the 5-sashimi platter.  Salmon was by far everyone's favorite
Wagyu takaki: This melts in your mouth, if you enjoy eating raw beef in any shape or form you will like this
Black pork belly skewer: Perfectly cooked pork belly, not too chewy. Similar to Korean cooked belly
Black cod: Really soft and easily breaks.  Texture was really great.  I am normally not a huge cod fan, but I enjoyed this dish
Suzuki carpaccio: Another really great dish, we ordered 1 plate initially, finished it, and ordered an extra one...
Wagyu nigiri with uni: I really liked the wagyu nigiri and usually love uni, but there was more sea-flavor in the uni than I would have liked / enjoyed.  Would likely pass next time
Buta Kim: Ordered this after seeing a video on yelp of the egg breaking!  It was okay, would skip next time, Kimchi was too salty
Roasted Duck: Would skip next time... was pretty good, but there was a pretty strong duck smell that came out while eating
Green Tea Ice Cream: Super quality, top notch
Homemade Grapefruit Ice Cream: I expected more of a sorbet but was pretty chunky and had pieces of grapefruit in it.  Served with grape and blueberries and is a really nice way to finish your meal

Service was also very good.  Place is really small (10-12 tables?) and popular, so definitely plan on waiting if you go.",5.0
2012,"Japanese tapas? Ok sorry correction; pardon my knowledge it's called Izakaya. The name ""izakaya"" is a compound word consisting of ""i"" (to stay) and ""sakaya"" (sake shop) (from wiki) and they mean it when you need some sake (or beer, chu-hai, soju, sochu or any of the alcoholic beverage they allow you to order) I did a taste testing here between if you dont drink alcohol with the food and if you did what would be the difference. My conclusion: it tasted much better with alcohol.

Starter:
Tsumami starter:  Baby squid, Takowasabi, and Spicy Jellyfish.
The spicy jellyfish was more sweet than spicy to me with a good crunch.
Takowasabi was a good twist; with chopped up raw octopus and fresh wasabi, it had a salty spicy kick to it.
Baby squid; they weren't kidding when they said fermented. Raw fermented baby squid that you have to be very caution while eating. Put the whole thing in your mouth or it will squirt. It has a nice crunch but lots of juice from the fermentation. Also it's very  fishy taste.

Fried:
Agedashi tofu: Very fresh Homemade tofu covered with corn starch and deep fried served in a bowl of starchy light soy sauce dipping sauce topped with and finely crushed radish bonito flake.

Appetizer:
Spinach: cooled blanched spinach pressed into a cube topped with bonito flakes with a small teapot of dark soysauce (beware of how salty the soy sauce can be)
Iso Chikuwa: two pieces of fried fish cake covered with battered and deep fried then cut into eight 1/4 inch x 4 inch pieces and then stacked covered with a crushed herbal leaf. soft and chewy.

Grilled:
Jumbo Squid: Jumbo squid grilled to perfection glazed with teriyaki sauce. sliced and served with japanese mayo and chili pepper sauce.

Dessert:
Roasted tea blanc-manger: roasted tea panne cotta topped with tapioca and red bean paste. subtle tea flavor with the sweet milky taste of the milk. kind of like a roasted milk tea gelatin.
Sweet potato brulee: creamy taste of the sweet potato kind of like a thick puree with the crispy thin sugar glaze with every bite.

Special:
Roasted duck with Foie Gras: Two pieces of creamy rich Foie Gras lightly fried on each side with tender pieces of roasted duck thinly sliced cooked medium rare. surrounded with a pool of  house special infused sauce maybe made with teriyaki, soy, chili pepper and wasabi. What ever it was it was able to trick my senses.

Food was extra ordinary. Good pricing. table setting were very cozy. Also very good service.",5.0
2015,"I'm so happy we stumbled upon this spot during a Yelp search for a last-minute dinner spot on a Sunday night.

Everything about this place feels genuine to an experience in Japan. The sake cups are handmade by the chef and each dish is prepared with such attention to detail.

The wait can take a long time as the restaurant is tiny! So put your name down on the list and take a stroll.

My only tip is to go out of comfort zone and try something you wouldn't normally get at a yakitori spot. There's also a daily special menu you should definitely order off of.",5.0
2016,"We got here ~6:30pm Thursday night  and the line was already far out the door - we had to wait ~90 minutes which is really pushing it, at least for me. A few urges to leave during the wait, but a note for next time to make a reservation because hitting their minimum spend was not difficult at all.

What we tried:

Sake flight - 3 flight of selection which went very well with the food
5 Types of Sashimi - really great selection that day - kanpachi was the best
Yuba Spoon - delicious and smooth concoction of flavors, fragrant taste the uni, but a bit overwhelmed by the tofu
Corn Tempura - not many places that offer corn tempura - delightful, sweet taste like funnel cake
Chicken Karrage - moist, tasty, but nothing out of ordinary
Chicken Cartilage - interesting for a few bites, but heavy since its fried - would be great drunk food
Fried String Ray Fin - interesting flavor and texture, should try, but only recommend one fried dish at a time
Premium Beef Tongue - probably the best beef tongue dish I have ever had- quality was amazing - enjoyed with the salt though the truffle oil was just a tad too much
Grilled Eel - special of the day, first time having fresh eel and it was moist and tender
Mini Kasien Don - standard don with uni, snowcrab, and ikura
Homemade Grapefruit Yogurt ice cream - definitely unique and refreshing way to end the meal
Roast Tea Pudding - pretty light and tasty - would try if you like pudding / mousse consistency

Personal favorite was the beef tongue with salt and truffle, the fresh grilled eel and the selection of sashimi that day.

Service was attentive and the waitresses were very accommodating and helpful! They gave us good recommendation and helped us matched sake for our meal.

Make sure you have to make reservation unless you don't mind to stay in line for more than an hour. The restaurant is small and all-time busy.

Price is reasonable and large variety of food selection. Ingredients are fresh and some of them are imported from Japan. Foie gras is on their menu after the ban was revoked. Beef tataki and the seared duck are so decent.

After waiting, I had high expectations. Service was on point for my whole experience. From the waitress giving us a warm towel to wipe our hands as we were seated, to the waitress educating us on the food and sake menu, to overall friendly staff.

The food was good. What stuck out for me was the corn tempura and rock shrimp tempura! I wasn't a fan of the broiled beef tongue.

:: Corn tempura with green tea salt - glad we tried this, but not my favorite dish. it's pretty much what you'd expect a fried bundle of corn to be ;)
:: Pork belly skewer - texture was tougher than I expected; nothing special
:: Roasted duck Kiraku style - tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly
:: Grilled rice ball (onigiri) - I prefer the one from Ippuku, but this one was different, wrapped with a green leaf
:: Grilled jumbo squid - best bang for your buck! tender and delicious. I'd prefer to share this with a group of people though, unless you can't get enough squid
:: Blanc-manger - sweet end to the meal! a light mousse with a roasted tea flavor

This is definitely a gem in the Berkeley area. Great izakaya experience and food at reasonable prices.

I'd definitely recommend grabbing a seat and trying this when you can! FYI, reservations require a $30pp minimum spend. Although the restaurant is quite small and only seats 35-40 people, they can also host groups for birthday parties.",4.0

2017,"Dined there last night. Was great! Loved a few dishes we had. The crab and broccolini was a tad too salty, still delicious. The beef tataki was delicious! The black cod was sweet and savory...exactly how I was imagining. We asked the waitress about the jellyfish which she said was one of her favorites. Not for either of us! It was pretty gross. We were trying something new and looked to her to guide us. Aside from that, the food was very delicious! It is a small place that I almost passed a few times trying to find it. I would recommend this place to any people in the Berkeley area. Their sweet potato crem brûlée was yummy too",4.0

We had a good variety of items -- Wags beef tataki, tuna cheek, karaage chicken, grilled mackerel, tempura corn, salmon mixed rice -- and all were excellent. The real stand outs were the roast duck, perfectly cooked and delicious, and the fresh unagi which was unspeakably toothsome.",5.0
2016,"Can't believe it's my first visit! I guess I got stuck on Ippuku and Sumika, my two favorites in the Bay Area. There's also the fusion-y Gochi for novelty factor, Iroriya, and some of the Korean izakaya's in the South Bay.

Compared to the others, I'd rank it highly but not above Ippuku or Sumika. With the crowded tables, simple decor and loud ambience, it feels a little more traditionally Japanese than Ippuku, which is more like fine food in a hip Tokyo club. Overall impression was that it was a little more inventive than straight izakaya fare, while still tasting very Japanese. I'll need to give it another try to be sure of my rankings.

The particular dishes we ordered came out a touch saltier than expected -- the surprise sauce brushed on the grilled rice ball, and the salty crab with broccolini. I thought all were tasty and would happily have tried more on the menu. We didn't get to the squid, which we often order elsewhere, or the desserts, which we were too full for.

Next time we'll make a reservation. Glad to have this place in Berkeley!",4.0
2014,"I am so ridiculously glad I was able to try this establishment.

Oh somehow I wish I could end the review like that, but this restaurant encompasses so much more. It's located on Telegraph, squashed right in the center block between Parker and Blake St., and be warned, it's a small restaurant, given this popularity, there is going to be a wait during the normal hours of dinner service.

First time I wanted to try this place, my friend was quite hungry and he didn't want to wait the 15-30 minutes so we ended up eating at the Peruvian place in the plaza thingy next door. The next time we were to get dinner, I told him I am putting my foot firmly down and we will wait for a table because I wanted to try Kiraku.

Queue up to the time we were able to obtain a table, we were handed hot towels, menus, and one of the waiters came by and introduced the restaurant. Kiraku specializes, and excels, at being an Izakaya establishment. Izakaya style encompasses drinking Sake, and eating small tapas-style dishes.

We ended up ordering 3-4 items on the daily special, and several items off the regular menu. Yes, we also ordered Sake, and that was actually really good.

Sake- Dewa San San Green Ridge

Food

Oyako-don
Chicken Karaage
Fried Chicken Cartliage
Rock Shrimp Tempura w/ Mayo
Agedashi Tofu
Roast Duck Kiraku Style
Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi
Water Clams on skewers
Grilled Tsubodai
And finally a Chirashi-like don

I'm not much of an alcohol person and I don't drink much, but the Sake was really good. It was smooth and had a hint of green apple. We ordered a carafe of it, and it had its own opening for ice so it doesn't dilute the Sake. Isn't that cool?

Moving on to the food. Everything came out really fast. There were four of us, so before you think, ""oh my god this guy is so fat"" it wasn't just my friend and I, it was 3 friends and I.

The Oyako-don was really good. Well everything is really good, but the Oyako-don is eggs, chicken, and mushroom over rice, and it was cooked so well. The chicken wasn't dry, the toppings were seasoned very well, and when you mix everything together you get all the flavors it was designed to give. The Chicken Karaage had a light batter and maintained its juiciness. Fried Chicken Cartilage? Crunchy as you expect, but it won't get stuck in-between your teeth, which is really good. They utilized spicy mayo mixture with the Rock shrimp, so you have to be a bit careful with those who are sensitive to spicyness, but the shrimp was fried nicely, and it had the crunch you get from shrimp that is really fresh.

The Agedashi tofu, warm, and flavorful. It's a fried tofu and bathed in a soy sauce like broth, with ginger, daikon, green onion, and bonito flakes, and it tastes oh so amazing. The roast duck comes medium, and is so juicy, flavored so well. It's a must have dish.

Moving on, the rest is from the daily specials menu, and the Hokkaido Scallop sashimi, we were told is flown in from Japan (maybe, maybe not who knows?) and it was amazing. It has the firmness of a cooked scallop, but it's so simple, and has subtle flavors that make you want to order another. One of my friends said that if these scallops are actually Hokkaido Scallops, then these are the best scallops in the world.

Water clams, I did not get to taste but I was told it was grilled, and was juicy and still had a bit of the natural salt flavor from the sea. The Grilled Tsubodai was grilled very well, it wasn't dry, it had flavor, and it was nice addition to our meal. Finally the Chirashi-like don, I don't know what it was called, but it was chirashi like. It had salmon roe, marinated salmon sashimi, snow crab, uni, and a few other toppings I can't remember. My friend told me everything tasted so well and fresh. I am a bit bummed I didn't bum some off him but I'll try to order it next time.

I really enjoyed the meal, it was and will always be a good experience. The waiters/waitresses are so kind and friendly, they always greet people who are about to be seated, answer questions, and take very good care of their patrons.

Our bill was... quite the expensive ($100+) for 4 people, but it was well worth it. I for one can't wait to go again.

Cheers! I hope you have just as wonderful and flavorful, if not better, experience at Kiraku.",5.0
2016,"One word ""INSANE"".  A must, worth the wait!!  Best izakaya Japanese food ever!!  Chef Daiki has great concepts.  The Buta-Kim OMG delicious.  The Kobe skewer is crack couldn't stop.  Little stuff like Moro Q was incredible.   One of my favs...   Thank you",5.0
2014,"Pros: Good quality, friendly and quick service.
Cons: Small menu, a little on the pricey side, small venue, and if you want to make reservations you have to spend at least $30/person. Also, we spent $100 and wasn't completely full.

We got 3 sashimi items, the homemade tofu, beef tataki and green tea ice cream.  I LOVE tofu and the night we came here the tofu was so good we had to get another order before we left. However, beside the tofu, the only other thing that stood out was the Peruvian Tuna. Quality was so good it tasted like toro and melted in our mouths! Amazing! We wanted to try the bone marrow since we are huge fans of bone marrow, but they ran out, which is why we ended up getting the second order of tofu.

I would like to come back to try a few other things that i saw other people ordering.  The menu seemed a little limited which is why we didn't seem to order much, plus it was hard to order since there weren't any pictures and I'm a huge fan of picture when it comes to menus! We'll see how it goes, I would like to forgo making a reservation and see how long the wait is since the last time we came there was a small line at the door.

Overall, I can see why people like this place but I'll need more visits to make an absolute decision. 3 stars is based on my first time experience.",4.0
2014,"A fellow Izakaya enthusiast and I were trying to get into Kiraku for over a year--not that we've been consistently trying for over a year, it just so happened that our attempts spanned over a period of so long, so I was pretty stoked when I called their answering machine probably 2-3 times the day of and they called me back saying ""WTF WHY YOU CALL SO MUCH HERE'S YOUR DAMN SEAT, SHOW UP ON TIME.""

Actually, they didn't say that, but I was really glad that I made reservations because the line was out the door of the cozy establishment and into the street, and everyone in line looked pretty pissed off when they saw me and my two friends walk in with reservations. One thing that they did mention over the phone when I made the reservations is that each reservation comes with a thirty dollar minimum spending tag, which was easily filled up by our merry group of three with the following:

Tsumami Sampler
This is surprisingly becoming standard in a lot of Izakayas I've been to in the states. We opted for the Takowasabi, Aburi Mentaiko, and the Karasumi. The Karasumi/Mentaiko is a litle on the salty side, so you might want to order something like edamame to kind of neutralize the salt. This plus a nice cold glass of imoujouchu kept my stomach at bay while the busy kitchen kept up with the flurry of orders.

Kisu Tempura
The Kisu is a little chewier than what I expected; the tempura batter was very light and crispy.

Buta Kimchi
The Kimchi was surprisingly not a salty, mushy mess and the pork belly seasoned very well.

Regular/Nankotsu Kara-age
My Izakaya-enthusiast friend and I usually tend to favor just the nankotsu, but our other friend decided he wanted one with real meat too. Probably one of the better nankotsu kara-ages I've tried on this side of the bay -- can't really speak much about the regular chicken kara-age because they all taste the same to me.

Grilled Beef Tongue
Cooked to absolute perfection. The surface was ever so slightly charred with the rich fatty oils glistening on top. Every bite was a damn party in my mouth. I was just a little bummed that I didn't know that they had a rendition of the dish cooked in truffle oil upon request.

Suzuki Carpaccio (Daily Special)
I usually like my sea bass cooked, but the Carpaccio was light and flavorful. I thought the yuzu and shichimi togarashi created a nice little contrast in flavors.

Snow Crab and Broccoli Uni-ae (Daily Special)
This was probably the highlight of the evening for me, at least until the Miyazaki A5. The creamy/semi-chewy on top of the crunchy broccoli, topped up with more creamy uni. This creation is definitely Iron Chef-worthy; I'm shocked that this isn't in Kiraku's regular rotation.

Black Cod Saikyo Yaki
Very well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. The way they cooked and broiled the cod made me swear I was eating butterfish and not cod.

Miyasaki A5 Tenderloin (Daily Special)
Pricey, but melts in your mouth. You get a 2oz serving for something like 20 dollars / person. Definitely worth a try if you've never experienced beef of the highest caliber -- you should try the slice without the dipping sauce they give you first and then with, and marvel at the world of difference.

Yaki Onigiri
Pretty standard issue, slightly grilled/shoyu-fied onigiri wrapped in a shiso leaf.

Most everything I ordered (except for the specials) was pretty routine Izakaya food that you can find in pretty much any Izakaya in Japan; Kiraku is quite possibly one of the most authentic Izakayas I've been to in California, although by ""authentic"" I mean that everything is up to par with what you'd expect from an Izakaya in Japan.

Their shochu/nihonshu selection was also impeccable (I believe they also offer flights) and their beer offerings were pretty standard. Solid five stars for the Berkeley area.",5.0
2014,"First off, this is my second time coming here

Ever since the first time I came here, I've been craving it and its literally something that I look forward to every time I come to Berkeley .

The wait time is pretty long, but its definitely worth it. We were a group of 3 and the only ones in the wait list but it still took a 30 minute wait. The servers were very kind and polite.

This time around me, my friend and my girlfriend ordered 2 orders of salmon sashimi, a beef tongue skewer, a pork belly skewer, yaki udon, jumbo squid, fried corn tempura, and a mini-kaisen donburi.

First was the corn tempura, and it had some green tea salt sprinkled on it that went really well with the sweet corn. It was crunchy, yet juicy!

Next came the salmon sashimi, and its usually what I look forward to most when I come here. It basically just melts in your mouth and is so fatty that its basically covered in its fishy oil. 6 pieces went into my stomach way too fast...

Once the beef tongue and pork belly skewers came on, it was gg for me. They were so fatty and had just the right amount of sauce on them. I say beef tongue over pork belly because the BBQ sauce was awesome.

The jumbo squid was the highlight of the night, and my favorite dish. Both visually appealing yet juicy and not tough, it was great to instagram AND eat!

The mini-kaisen donburi was so pretty that my friend was afraid to eat it with the big ass spoon . The fish ikura eggs were so good and exploded one by one!

Lastly, the yaki udon was so good, especially the octopus bits inside the pesto sauce. It made the texture of the dish both chewy and soft. Definitely a dish to try since its so unique!

So good. Can't wait to come again",5.0
2015,"The food here itself deserves full five stars. The only slight nuisance was the 1hr+ wait. The grilled black cod melt in my month while the lamb chops were well seasoned with some sort of teriyaki sauce, garnished with herbs. The roast duck was done to perfection, paired nicely with some loosely chopped green onions. Homemade tofu was unexpectedly served cold with ginger - the only dish I would not re-order in the future.",5.0
2013,"Kiraku is a very authentic izakaya with delicious food and great service.  I've been here twice and the food here is probably comparable to flying to Japan.  Because izakayas are basically like tapas (multiple small dishes for a variety of flavors), we ordered 8 dishes total.

Pork Belly Skewers (4 stars): The skewers were grilled nicely and they had a good, salty flavor.  However, we had to order two skewers because one skewer has two small pieces of meat, which is perfect for one person, but since there were two of us, we had to get two skewers.

Large Squid (4 stars): The squid had a nice smoky flavor mixed in with subtle hint of teriyaki sauce.  This goes surprisingly well with the Japanese mayo sauce and I would recommend this dish to party of two people or more because it is very large and fulfilling.

Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage (5 stars): One of my favorite dishes ever!  I adore cartilage and the crunchiness from the cartilage and saltiness from the batter were heaven for me.  Disclaimer: Most people don't like cartilage because it doesn't have a lot of flavor, so try cartilage more for the crunchiness.

Corn tempura (5 stars): Another favorite from Kiraku.  This dish comes with four patties of corn tempura sprinkled with green salt.  The corn tempura comes out piping hot and it retains heat well.  The corn tastes slightly buttery and the salt works well with it.  I would only recommend this dish if you have someone to eat with as corn tempura can be a little heavy.

Beef Bone Marrow (4.5 stars): This dish I would hesitate a little to recommend to people.  I enjoy the rich and creamy flavor of bone marrow, but the texture and the flavor is not for everyone.  Bone marrow is an acquired taste and the richness from the oil/marrow may be off-putting to some customers.  However, if you enjoy rich food or are adventurous, I would say the bone marrow topped with the fried slices of ginger is one of the best dishes at Kiraku.

Homemade tofu-- special of the day (5 stars): The homemade tofu was the bomb!  By itself, it was a little plain even though it had bonito and I believe green onions, but once you added a couple drops of soy sauce, it was like the tofu underwent a chemical reaction!  This dish goes down smoothly and if you come to Kiraku and they have this on their daily menu, take it!

Sashimi-- special of the day ( ): I have no idea what it tastes like.  I hate fish, but my mom really enjoyed the nine pieces of sashimi.  There were a total of 3 fish so 3 pieces of each type of fish: yellowtail, salmon, and snapper (?).  My mom said that the sashimi was really fresh and I though the presentation of the sashimi was beautiful so if you enjoy fish, I suppose you should try this dish.

Tea Blanc Manger (5 stars):  One of the most original desserts ever created.  Kiraku specially makes this dessert which has a consistency of panna cotta, but the cream has a small hint of green tea and this dessert is topped of with small, clear tapioca balls and a small amount of mashed beans.  The beans, the tapioca, and the cream all work together to give the customer a refreshed feeling at the end of the meal.  Although the dessert is slightly sweet, it is very light and rejuvenating and if you come to Kiraku, you must have this dish!

Service (4 stars):  The waiters and waitresses were very polite and kind and they kept refilling our water and tea.  However, because some of them are originally from Japan, they have some difficulty explaining some of the dishes to customers.  On the menu, some items have the romanized Japanese name for their title and they don't write a description of the dish (how it's prepared, what it is etc.).  Our waiter couldn't explain what type of fish Hamacha was or what cut we're ordering or how it was prepared so we felt a little apprehensive about ordering some dishes.  If Kiraku could write a description of what some food items were, I think it would be easier for some customers to be more adventurous in trying new foods.",4.0
2016,"Hands down best Japanese in south side Berkeley that is walking distance to campus on all fronts (food, service, vibes); worth a student's splurge once in a blue moon. Good service, not too in your face but kind of like the observant admirer that does a lot of things for you from the distance without being too obnoxiously obvious about it? (If I don't need to ask for X and X often, it's pretty good service.) EVERYTHING SEEMS GOOD but we got the duck kiraku (well, namesake's are usually good), the sweet potato brûlée, salmon sashimi (SO GOOD), the fried taro things... Note the portions are small, which is why it adds up. BUT WORTH.

If you're paying the same (ish) for Joshuya's, I'd say: if Japanese restaurants were siblings, Joshuya's would be the poser that's smug in his minimal (but existent) nascent talents while Kiraku would be the smaller and unassuming sibling that never explicitly shows off to their parents -- but in her own way goes about striving for excellence without comparing herself to her obsequious brother.

Ah, the only thing is it's super small; came here Saturday night at 9:30p and still waited for a bit. I don't usually give out five stars, but well deserved. And now the wait shall be longer.",5.0
2014,"Came in 10 minutes to close after being rejected from another restaurant who wouldn't take us 20 minutes to close.  Thank God!  Otherwise we might not have made it in to try Kiraku, run by young chef Dai Saito and his team of waitninjas who provided a delicious array of great food, reasonably priced sake, and super pleasant service.

The highly vaunted corn tempura is a must have for sure, big and crispy discs of golden crunchiness.  However, don't deter away from another amazing fried dish and that's the nankotsu.  Yes, chicken cartilage can be delicious.  I've only had it as robata prior to trying Kiraku's rendition, and once you soak the golden nuggets in fresh-squeezed lemon, it becomes a gustatory adventure of textures and mouthfeel, which is unrivaled!

Other standouts followed.  The kurodai snapper sashimi was a pleaser, super delicious and fresh.  We enjoyed spoons of yuba(fresh bean curdle) with uni, which were creamy and delicious.  We had Asahi on Draft and a really wonderful reasonably priced carafe of sake.  

The mini seafood donburi was also good, with salmon, ikura, crab and uni - however I would say that I expected a little more pop out of the flavors there, nonetheless its plentiful and well-executed.

The team was so pleasant and chef Dai is genuine and warm in both his tableside manner and culinary display.

All said, I can't wait to go back and try more of the exciting items on the menu, as there are plenty to try.

Get yourself there!",5.0
2014,"It's really good. Probably the best izakaya in town (more options than ippuku) and while the line is long, if you get a reservation you can skip it. The only catch is you have to spend $30 each for a rezzie, but that's hardly a challenge here (esp if you're drinking).

A lot of what we ate were on the daily specials, and I'd recommend you do the same as it reflects what's newest and freshest but other things that stood out were the miso cod, nankostu karaage, and beef tongue. Also when you get the appetizers, you can get 3 for like 12 bucks which is actually a great deal. So do that.

We had some exceptionally fancy Miyazaki A5 beef. It was unreal. They might not have it when you're there, but you should ask.",5.0
2015,"Went here for my birthday dinner yesterday and what can I say... This is the best tapas foods that I ever eat! All of the food I ordered were right at the point. Other than the tasty foods, presentation of the foods are so cute and artistic too!

Food we ordered:
- corn tempura - simple and yummy!
- roasted tea blac-manger - just right
- green tea ice cream with Mochi - not your normal green tea ice cream. More milky!
- roasted duck - delicious!
- beef tongue - tasty!
- pork skewer - totally outta the world!
- sake
- foie gras with daikon - absolutely delicious! The foie gras totally melt in my mouth!!!

Totally will come back again!!!",5.0
2016,"This was delicious. I've been twice so far. Once with my boyfriend and then again with my mother.

Be prepared, it's cramped and you will have to wait for a table. The first time I came we got in quickly about 30 minutes to an hour after opening. The second time we got there right when it opened and there had been a line of people, so we came back an hour later.

Also. These are very small bites. Because it's tapas. So be prepared to order a lot.  I liked everything better with their sake selection.

I've had:
the corn tempura
Suzuki Carpagio
Uni shooters
Both Sake samplers
Karage Chicken
Karage shrimp
Scallops
And rice

Both times were great. I can tell you right away that the Suzuki Carpagio is my favorite thing on the menu. It's citrusy and bright and extremely flavorful. You are gonna want all of the sauce.

The corn tempura was amazingly unique. It was sweet and delicious, but balance it with something bright and salty.

I loved the Uni shooters. The ingredients were fresh, rich and slightly sweet from the uni and creamy tofu. The salmon eggs were salty and delicious.

The chicken karage was amazing. It was fresh and flavorful with Japanese mayo.
The shrimp was equally flavorful. I don't usually like fried shrimp but this was great. The sauce on top was beautiful too.

The scallops were rich and buttery. And the sauce they were nested in was quite delicious as well.

I'd eaten here before without drinking along with the meal. But the sake samplers we had were perfect. We were able to mix a lot of flavors, and they all went well with the food.

The waitress was very polite and pleasant. She was also extremely helpful and approachable. She taught us the different grades of sake and explained how they were made.

Great meal. I hope to come back soon.",5.0
2017,"The last time I came here it was Cal Day and the line was super long. I visited on a not so busy weekend and while there was a wait, it wasn't major. I had anticipated on having a spectacular dining experience after all the rave reviews but Kiraku fell flat on meeting my expectations. While service was good and the dishes came out promptly, I felt the dishes lacked something. Was it depth of flavor? Was it complexity? 3 stars for effort. I might have to revisit to see if this was a one off day for them.",3.0
2014,"One of the best meals we've had in a long time. This place is quite small, and completely packed, with a waiting list well after 9:30pm. And this was on a Wednesday!

The quality of every dish is outstanding - the sashimi was incredibly fresh, and served with a high quality grated was about paste. The corn tempura was sprinkled with just the right amount of deliciously savory seaweed salt. We also tried the chicken karaage, kobe beef tatami, and pork Kakuni-  all were tasty and exquisitely balanced in taste and texture.

Service was also notably friendly and attentive. Despite the busyness, the servers seated us as quickly as possible, and never let our cups run dry.

I can't recommend this place enough!",5.0
2014,"This place rocks.

My favorite was the sashimi platter, which had a various assortment of very fresh fish. I guess it depends what's available at the time but when we were there the black cod was my absolute favorite.  The duck breast was also very flavorful. They have a nice assortment of sochu there. I tried the sampler. I think this place is Okinawan owned or maybe they have some sort of okinawan connection because they had awamori there.  Also you must try the yuzu mocha, filled with cream. It was divine.",4.0

2014,"We were really excited to eat here based on all the reviews on yelp. It started well with the garlic edamame (surprisingly great). Then the fried garlic (ok) and the pork cheek skewer (yum). And the corn fritters were just too good to be true.

Then things started to go downhill, but really slowly.

The next dish, the chicken karaage was crispy on the outside, but fatty in a way that I didn't really enjoy so I personally wouldn't order again.

After that the grilled rice balls were not crispy at all (sadface) and had a coating of miso paste and hot sauce.

Then we had to wait with no food... For I dunno 15 minutes for the last two dishes to come out. They said sorry but made no amends.

And to make things worse, we were sitting right next to a regular patron who they gave 2 corn fritters to on the house. And he had 4 dishes on his table one of which should have probably been ours since we got there before him.

Finally the pork kimchee and sushi over rice came out. Both were good.

Now my bf doesn't want to ever go there again. I'm going to try it out one more time but I have to find someone else to make the trip with.

At least the tea pudding was amazing.

Would def get again:

Corn fritters are really great. Crispy and fresh.

Lychee sake was sweet and great tasting. It'd be better if they could somehow get it super ice cold. I want to go to a store and buy some.

Tea pudding. So cute, topped with a little red bean, cream, and mini white tapioca.

Ok:

Chicken karaage was crispy but I spent a lot of time trying to avoid eating the fat.

I wasn't sure how the fried garlic would be prepared. Apparently like a fried pickle or okra- battered and fried.

Never again:
Grilled rice balls.

Oh and just know if you order oolong tea it's served as ice tea.",3.0
2015,"I love this place. This is my first yelp review even though I use yelp all the time. I want to 'pay it forward' after all those previous yelp reviewers that have helped me discover wonderful new places to eat.

Kiraku uses high quality ingredients and puts them together in creative, delicious combinations. The izakaya tapas style lets you try many small portion dishes. My favorites are the waygu beef tataki, uni and salmon roe on homemade bean curd skin served in two spoons, corn tempura, black cod, the chopped fatty tuna over a bowl of rice, and the foie gras over a stewed turnip. I like that they also offer more exotic options like baby octopus and fermented squid for those days when you're feeling adventurous (and not very hungry!). And comfort foods like ramen and udon.

Reservations are a must on weekends but you must be willing to commit to spending at least $30pp. Street parking is easy to find and it's free after 6pm. Friendly, efficient service in a small, intimate setting. A must try if you like authentic Japanese food and want something other than sushi.",5.0

2014,"I actually really really like Kiraku.

We waited for 40 minutes for this place and afterwards, I wasn't disappointed at all.
They may not serve sushi but their prices are comparable.

Ordered:
Bone Marrow
Corn Tempura
Duck Breast
Jumbo Squid
Clams in Sauce
Sweet Sake

Bone Marrow was flavorful but a bit salty. Quite possibly for you to wash down with lots and lots of sake.
Corn Tempura was delicious with the green tea salt bringing through complex flavors.
Duck Breast, grilled perfectly and sauced lovingly.
Jumbo Squid was not the best I have ever had.
Clams in Sauce was a waste of money. Good thing it's on their seasonal menu, I would hate to see this thing make it onto the main.

All the food was like having fireworks in your mouth, they were all so fresh, tasteful, and had the perfect texture.  It was obvious from the Tea to the Sauces that Everything was made Fresh and from Scratch!

They have a very small seating area so come early or come late.  Most of the dishes are small so order a bunch but be careful, the dishes add up fast and will be costly!  Also, just order one of the ""After Sake"" dishes; we ordered a couple and 1/2 already filled us up and we had to box up left overs.

Nankotsu - best I've had.  Small bits, cooked well and tender enough with crunch to swallow easily.  Many places don't cook well and its tough to eat.

Pesto udon was weird but had good flavor.

Can I saw too much truffle oil on the gyu tan?

2015,"I usually tip Japanese restaurant very well. 15% at least, 25% if the food and service is good. However this is the only time I only gave 2 cents tip. I know this may piss them very much but honestly, I am pissed too.

Following reasons for why:

1. One of our orders never come

2. They limited our dine time for 1 hour, while majority of the time we were facing an empty table.

3. Appetizer came in the middle

4. They accidentally broke a bottle of beer. The beer messed up my dress and broken glass almost cut my foot. Nothing but one ""I am so sorry"" after they cleaning up the mess, replacing the beer, and apologizing for the people sitting near us several times.

5. Last but not least, when I asked for bill, after all the inconvenience and our 1 hour dine time expired with still one order missing, they gave me a $0.99 Pocky, yes, the cheap snack from the convenience store nearby, as an apology! I feel insulted by this cheap apology! After such a bad experience, a free ice cream or some discount( by the way the bill for two of us is $72, and we run into the pho next door because my friend is still hungry!) will be appropriate and I will at least leave 15% for poor service. But come on, Pocky???? That is a service level that beyond poor. It is extraordinary! I just can't image anything cheaper than that.

2011,"My first izakaya experience - oishikatta!

Heard about Kiraku from a friend, as it recently opened in Berkeley, and I was excited b/c while in Japan, I didn't go to izakayas due to the smoky atmosphere and my lack of understanding Nihongo, so thank goodness for Kiraku back here in Cali (no smoking and English menus). It still has that Japanese feel of being intimate, though, and the waitresses were kind and welcomed us with ""Irasshaimase""s.

I arrived with 4 other friends, and it was a bit difficult to get seating, since it's quite the small venue, but after we were seated, our eyes widened at the different kinds of delicious-sounding plates, drinks, and specials. We were like this: O_O

We ended up getting the following:
-boiled octopus: delicious if you don't mind eating what looks like little red octopi
-mushroom tempura w/ lime salt: nice and lightly crisped
-buta-kim (pork, kimchee, egg): good spicy kick, and the egg was the best part
-giant squid: the right amount of chewy with a Japanese-esque sauce and mayo w/ chili powder sauce on the side
-chicken karaage: bigger than your average karaage, but still was not overcrisped; also served with Japanese mayo :)
-daikon fois gras: small yet expensive dish packed with a powerful taste and perfect texture
-ten don: we were still a bit hungry after the other foods, but with the rice and shrimp from this ten don, we were satisfied with the amount of food

For drinks, we ordered the two sake samplers. Each had three glasses of different sake, and we enjoyed sipping, tasting, and commenting on the differences between them. It was also nice that the waitress politely explained the kinds of sake to us as she poured.

Even though my group was made of college students and recent alums, both with a college budget, we all agreed that Kiraku is well worth it because of the vast array of interesting Japanese appetizer choices as well as the selection of good quality sake they serve.",5.0
2017,"been meaning to try this place out and we were able to get seats last weekend!  We had to wait for I'd say about an hour to an hour and a half total but we just killed time walking around the stores so it wasn't that much of a hassle.  The venue is a nice cozy izakaya styled restaurant. Not too big but I'd say big enough to enjoy it with a rather big party.  The food was absolutely amazing.
-I didnt have a problem with a single dish except maybe the brocolini tossed with uni and crab wasn't as good as I expected but other than that everything was exceptional.  
-We started with the yuba(soft tofu skin) with uni and ikura. The ikura was very well flavored in a soy marinate that gave a great accent to the entire dish.
-corn tempura - never had this else where and I am pretty surprised that other places don't! It was absolutely wonderful
-striped bass(suzuki) carpaccio - my favorite dish here. Very flavorful yet well balanced.
-wagyu beef tataki - good but nothing too special Id say. Simple japanese flavors with ponzu and momiji oroshi with grated garlic and some ginger. Ive had better I must say
-pork kakuni - probably one of the best I've had in the bay area. Great balance of saltiness with sweetness. Super tender pork belly. And a great egg to go along with it
-we finished off with the foie gras yaki onigiri which was good in a sense but a little heavy on the sauce I'd say for the foiegras. The demigras that came with it overpowered the entire dish which I cant say I loved. I would prefer something more balanced with some fruit essence.

If they offer true fresh sashimi plate, I would definitely suggest that. It is pricey, around $40 a plate for 4 different types of fish,  that are 3 servings each. Pricey yes, but the quality was absolute. All the different types of fishes were fresh and A+ quality.   The colors of the maguro and the sake were so pronounced that I have never seen it in a long time.

During the meal, I tried 3 different types of sojhu. My favorite being the the sesame seed sojhu.  It was delicate yet smokey.

2014,"Stopped by the other night with the bf without a reservation but managed to be seated within 15 minutes (yes!) Though the restaurant is a bit on the smaller side, do not be fooled. This place is delish. We ordered a few dishes and were pleasantly surprised.

Corn tempura: Delicious! Would highly recommend giving this a try. I'm not a fan of tempura in general but this dish was mighty tasty. The green tea salt gave it a nice touch.

Roasted duck: This is a MUST. Definitely the most tender duck that I have ever tasted. You can't stop by Kiraku without getting this dish! It was seasoned to perfection. Only downside was that it's definitely on the pricier side.

Beef tongue w/ truffle oil & salt: This dish was only okay. It tasted similar to the beef tongue that I've had at other Japanese restaurants. A bit rubbery texture-wise. Nothing special.

Salmon carpaccio: I really, really enjoyed the carpaccio here. I'm a carpaccio fiend so this was definitely one of my favs. The salmon was cut beautifully and had great flavor.

Chicken Udon: This was probably the most plain thing I had. The soup was pretty bland and I was not impressed.

An issue I had here was how it took quite a while for each dish to come out. Also...the tables were a bit too close to each other. The whole time I felt like my elbow was going to bump into the girl in the table next to me. But I understand since the restaurant is small. Other than that, I will probably stop by again.",4.0
2013,"I am sad that this restaurant is not recognized among Berkeley students.
This is probably close to fine dining as you can get in Berkeley without breaking your budget.

Here goes:

Salmon Carpaccio: Sophisticated, Meticulous. My favorite dish here. It was so good that I was thinking salmon carpaccio walking back home, sleeping, and the next morning. No words can explain it. Just try it =).
Deep Chicken Cartilage: Who thought that eating joints would ever taste good? Man. Remember those pieces of chicken you spit out as a kid because they were too hard for your teeth. Imagine those softened, surrounded with meat, and fried. YUM!
Black Pork Belly: Finely cooked meat in all its glory and perfection. NOMS.
Corn Tempura: Not as exquisite as the others mentioned already, but I can see why its a favorite among college student. It's very simple--fried corn with green tea salt on top. Sometimes though, when you're eating in a fine restaurant, these simple entrees are a good break where you can just indulge and not just slowly taste the food.",5.0
2013,"4.5/5. My go to place for late night take out last year, before they cut back on the hours: They're still open until 10:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and until midnight on weekends, but used to stay open one or even two hours past closing.

Kiraku is a small restaurant, so it gets crowded during dinner service. The wait usually dies down after 10 p.m. on weekends and after 9 on week days. Food is solid and it's best to come with others. You'll find most of your izakaya classics and the portions, though filling, are small and reasonably priced enough that you'll get to sample a wide variety of them. (Personally, for two people, I'd go with a rice bowl, two fried plates, an appetizer, and a grilled plate.) And if you're interested in getting take out, you should know that they only offer some dishes to go like oyako-don, Kiraku rib, yaki udon, chicken karaage, and a few others.

Also, they have a specials menu. According to the waitress, it's supposed to change on a daily basis. I guess I'll soon find out. Anyway, here are some of the dishes I've tried:

FRIED
*Lotus Roots Chips ($4): Solid. Very crunchy.
*Cartilage ($7.5): Good if you're into fried cartilage.
*Chicken Karaage ($8.5): Very good. Crispy on outside, but moist and tender on inside.
*Rock Shrimp Tempura ($9): Best I've had. Crispy, warm, and creamy all at once. Much better than the pricier ones at Jin Sho in Palo Alto. Also, you get a very generous amount of shrimp. One of the plates I order most here.
*Corn Tempura ($7): A table favorite when I go with friends. Light, sweet, and crispy. You get four huge pieces.

APPETIZERS
*Shime Saba ($8): Seared mackerel sashimi. Cuts are small, but flavorful.
*Albacore Tataki ($10): Nice and fatty. Melts in your mouth.
*Salmon Sashimi ($11): Salmon sashimi was very good, but I tend to stick with the grilled and fried plates here.
*Duck Potstickers ($6): Good.
*Roasted Duck Kiraku Style ($13.5): Used to come with foie gras until the ban.

GRILLED
*Wrapped Salmon ($10.5): Salmon and mushroom wrapped in foil. Good.
*Spicy Hamachi Kama ($13): Flavorful, but a tad bit dry for my taste.
*Crispy Bone Marrow ($6): Quite small, but packed a lot of flavor. Scooped up half the marrow into my Rock Shrimp Ten-Don to give an extra kick to the rice. And when the marrow ran out, I mixed my rice in it to eek out every last drop of oily goodness.
*Black Pork Belly Skewer ($3): Nice and fatty, but could have had more crisp.

SPECIALS
*Pork Kakuni ($10): Simmered pork belly with soft-boiled egg. Fist-sized, pork portion was bigger than I expected and the broth/sauce was very nice. Egg was perfectly cooked.
*Sausages ($5.5): 5 nicely cooked pork sausages with mustard on the side. Snappy, yet juicy.

NOODLES/RICE
*Oyako-Don ($8.5): Simmered Chicken and Egg Over Rice. One of the better ones I've had. Chicken could be a a bit more tender, but the egg and mushrooms are beautifully cooked. Comes with a liberal serving of perfectly steamed rice.
*Ramen ($8.5): Fine, but this isn't a ramen house. Egg isn't soft-boiled.
*Yuzu Chicken Udon ($9.5): Kind of small; wish there were more noodles/chicken, but the broth was flavorful.
*Rock Shrimp Ten-Don ($10): Good. Like the oyako-don, but with shrimp. Shrimp are soggier than the ones you get into the Rock Shrimp Tempura appetizer, but are still tasty. Get this if instead of the oyako-don if I'm not also ordering the rock shrimp tempura.
*Yaki Udon ($10.5): Interesting, but not my cup of tea. It's sautéed noodles with pesto and cabbage. Accidentally ordered it and probably wouldn't again.",4.0

My boyfriend and I had dinner here and had to wait over 30 minutes to get seats, even at 8pm. People sure take their time while eating here!

Corn Tempura ($7) - Although this is the most talked-about thing on Yelp and did indeed taste really good, I would not pay $7 to eat this again. It's literally just deep fried clumps of corn. Imagine the margins they are making on this - corn is so cheap! I think this would be more worth it if it were $4-5 max.

Duck ($14) - A little pricey but very good. It ends up coming to about $1 a piece, and the pieces were probably the length of your thumb (if you have average sized thumbs).

Omelette Salad ($9) - Funny story - we saw what a couple next to us had ordered and guessed by the description that it was an omelette salad. We couldn't have been more wrong. This salad came out looking exactly like a giant omelette and it is just filled with raw cabbage. This doesn't sound super appetizing but it was actually pretty good. However, I thought the sauce and flakes on top made the dish a little on the salty side for my taste. Portion-wise, it was one of the larger quantities for the price, so it was pretty filling.

Bone Marrow ($6) - The biggest rip off. My boyfriend was only able to scoop out about a tablespoon of marrow.

Squid ($10) - Very tasty and worth the price. You get a huge plate of squid that is dressed lightly in teriyaki sauce. It also comes with another creamy sauce on the side, but I actually thought the squid tasted better without it.

In conclusion, I don't regret trying Kiraku out, because the food certainly was pretty tasty, but I probably wouldn't come back again because nothing was worth returning for and the prices were a little steep for the quantities. The most worth-it item on the menu was probably the squid.",3.0
2015,"Itsa good joint.. The variety & creativity of dishes is good. Itsa small joint. Great servers, and a good variety of Izakaya dishes. Izakaya iza joint for drinking, and nibbling on small tasty snacks which has become a ""small plates"" major restaurant category for Japanese restaurants.  

At the table over the course of the evening we had a sampling of maybe 20 of Kiraku's offerings. ""tapas"" ranged  between GREAT --- Ok --- disappointing.

A few we had:  

Pickles: GREAT & interesting hand crafted
Sirloin: disappointing: on a stick, it was OK, 1 skinny stick, taste not great
Albacore ceviche: Great
Tofu - ""homemade"": Ok - came with a mini ""vegans unite"" banner
Salmon sashimi: Ok. Thin slices, the drinking man's raw fish
Corn tempura: GREAT & simple, not sumptin you see in Japan
Foie Gras:  Badly composed, tonkatsu like sauce & a thick diacon killed the (expensive) taste

I found that some dishes were over ""sauced""; on the other hand if you are ""sauced"" then they land in that desired taste zone.  Music was LOUD. Tooo loud. Causing adjacent table mates to shout at each other; at one point seemingly the cassette tape ended and there was a loud static blaring for a few minutes until the server across the room finally recognized our hand signal of distress and the LOUD musac track resumed. The music is NOT befitting the price of sitting at one of their tables.  While not subject to any techniques to ""Turn Tables"", I wondered if the volume level of the music was their not so subtle way of creating an annoyance that would prevent anyone from lingering.",3.0
2014,"This is more of a drinking place. So most dishes are small (sort of comparable to tapas). Which is awesome if you go with friends and want to share different things. We were there 3 people altogether, we ended up having probably 7-8 dishes there. They were all good.

2013,"My group of 3 showed up around 7pm on a Friday night, and we thankfully waited only about 10 minutes for a table.  We were expecting a long wait, so we were really pleased. I'm not sure whether this is typical, though.

To make a reservation here, you must agree to spend at least $30 per person on this meal. Ouch! This may be easier to achieve if you order alcohol, but we passed on the reservations because that is STEEP.

Here's what we ordered:
- Grilled beef tongue (5 stars): a big hit!
- Grilled whole squid (5 stars): another big hit!
- Hamachi kama (5 stars): a.k.a. yellowfin tuna collar (the neck area of the fish) - soft and tender.
- Special pork of the day (4 stars): tasty but a bit too salty.
- Corn tempura (3.5 stars): crunchy goodness.
- Pork ramen (3 stars): not bad.

Overall, tasty food - a bit pricey, but that's to be expected for the izakaya/Japanese ""tapas"" type restaurants in the area.  If you are a picky eater and don't like seafood or raw/semi-raw fish or beef, you may not get as much bang for your buck here!",4.0
2016,The wait was more than an hour but I wanted to wait after reading all the positive posts on Yelp. I love every dish I ordered! The food came out fast and all the servers were very helpful. Every portion is just enough for 3-4 people to share. The quality is top notch and all the ingredients used were well put together. I finished my dinner very happy and not feeling over ate. The restaurant is not big but it was efficiently run and manage. The experience was well worth the wait and my one night stay in Berkeley. I will definitely come back! You must try,5.0
2015,"""Kiraku!!"" That's exactly how my friend refers to this place - with exclamation marks to boot! And for good measure because this place rocks!

Let me start by saying that you should expect to wait to get a table. We got here for an early dinner at around 5:30pm to try to avoid the wait, but no such luck. We had to wait for about thirty minutes to get seats.

It's important to note that the portions here are small. The dishes are also expensive. So if you're on a budget, I suggest you stop by Tako Sushi or Joshu-ya for a roll or two before you head out here because you will not get full out of their tiny portions. However, you will be greatly satisfied by their quality of food. And the flavor - just deletable!

Personally, I haven't had a bad meal here. I've even enjoyed a couple of dishes here that I don't typically enjoy. For example, squid. Now, I really don't squid at all, but somehow this place makes squid taste like my favorite meal!

2013,"I was skeptical about izakaya before I came to Kiraku because I never understood how you could pay so much for small dishes that would take forever to fill you up. I brought my parents here during a visit, and I fell in love!

Starting with my favorite dish, the grilled squid was perfectly cooked so that there was a nice char on the outside but not overly rubbery on the inside. The sauce was extremely flavorful, and paired well with the flavored mayo on the side. The grilled mackerel was also grilled nicely so that the flakiness of the fish was still maintained. If you're looking for something more unique, try the taro balls. They have a similar flavoring to takoyaki, but you get the starchier texture of taro that I like.

In terms of the more substantial dishes, the buta kim was not a huge standout, but I do love kimchi and a good poached egg. The omelet salad had the same sauce on it, so the huge portion of cabbage helped alleviate the slight saltiness. One of my favorites was the chazuke, which is essentially rice in a dashi broth. It sounds simple, but the flavors were homey and the salmon on top was a nice touch as well.

The assorted sashimi platter definitely needs its own paragraph. The special that day included amberjack, snapper, and salmon. Each fish had its unique flavor and buttery texture, but overall the quality was the best that I've had in the Berkeley area.

As a whole, the meal will end up being relatively pricey but trust me when I say that it's well worth it. Kiraku is the perfect place for the izakaya experience, and all of the food lives up to the hype!",5.0

The food here was great..but I only have one vice which really has nothing to do with the restaurant.  NOT cool when your back is to the door and a homeless person enters the restaurant from behind you and confronts your for money.  Seriously need more people watching the door or something.

Other than that the food was good.  The corn tempura surprisingly works (haven't seen that before).  Also really liked the ceviche.  I was really looking forward to the bone marrow, after all it is ""god's butter"" but really couldn't taste much of it beyond the burnt garlic.",4.0

It's a very small, claustrophobic space with a WHOLE lot of tables jammed in tightly against one another, as one would expect when there's a line out the door. But when you're 6'6, as I am, you feel like a parent visiting a kindergarten classroom, and it's way stuffy, the air gets stale, and it's uncomfortable after a while. Especially once it gets full.

The food was described by my friend, who's far more fluent than I, as ""Japanese bar room food"" and I can see that being a good description. It's the type of food that makes you want to drink... so... spicy and/or salty, across the board. Overwhelming to my palate, to be truthful, and by the end of the first dried-fish dish (fish jerky) I was feeling thirsty and a little queasy. More saltiness, more spice, more kimchi, more fish flavors. Again, I think it's you're Japanese or a legit Japanese cuisine purist, this could be your game. For me... it was just my mouth screaming FISH! SPICE! SALT! and I found myself ""over it"" ten minutes in. To be clear, I eat Asian food about 10 times per week, the legit stuff, in San Francisco.

Jumbo squid is a must order. I have been to many places and also lived in Korea for a year where I had a lot of those grilled squid. This one by far is the best one I ever had. Very well cooked. Tender and chewy.

I had the grilled beef tongue which I'll give a 4 star maybe I should try the other one next time. Just average taste not very special. Had better ones at other places.

They have daily Menu so depending on your luck you may have different food choices. I wanted to try the bone marrow but it wasn't available that day.

The mountain yam and roe was really delicious. Had the sake sampler which I really liked. Paired with the sashimi and fresh octopus really well.

Minus one star for the wait time for the food.  Take a long time for each dish to come out.
The place is really small and the wait was long but is okay as long as the food is good.

Overall don't go if you are super hungry because you will have to wait a long time. Is on the expensive side so if you want to try their good selection and be full will cost you about $30 per person I would say. If you are looking for sushi rolls then this is not the place for you.",4.0
2013,"If you're looking for interesting Japanese - Izakaya style - in Berkeley and trying to decide between Kiraku and Ippuku, go to Ippuku. I'd been to Ippuku and loved it, but chose Kiraku for dinner recently hoping to strike gold twice. Kiraku, sadly, was a let down for me.

Our server was self-admittedly spacey and continued to prove this throughout the meal with forgotten dishes, dropped glasses and a seriously long wait for the bill despite repeated requests.

When we both ordered the yuzu chicken udon (it was a cold, rainy night) our server told us the chef doesn't like this (people ordering the same dish at the same table) but ended up letting us do it anyway. Uhhhhhhh....?

I found the soup rather bland and the chicken extremely fatty. I love Japanese soups but this one just didn't deliver.

The famed corn tempura was yummy as tempura typically is, but I'd likely not want more than a piece and you get four or five per order.

The standout at Kiraku for me was the homemade grapefruit yogurt ice cream. It's the only thing I sampled here worthy of a repeat visit. But I doubt I'll be making one.",2.0

We had several ""small plates"", the Agedashi tofu was delightful, and quite perfect.  The Hawaiian Kampachi was quite delicious and buttery, just the way sashimi should be.  Corn tempura was an interesting dish, never quite had corn in this fashion, fried in a tempura batter, but quite tasty.  The grilled pork belly was quite delicious as to be expected since it is porky goodniness!  Also, the Hazuke with Salmon was tasty as well with rice in a nice broth topped with the salmon.

Without a reservation it seemed like people were waiting for about an hour. It's a tiny place, probably only 30 people max can fit. Anyways on to the food. I got the lotus chips and the corn tempura for starters. The corn tempura is a must. Sooooo good. The lotus chips are good too. We also got the yuzu which is basically tofu with sea urchin on top. It was really good, but small. They are literally on two spoons. The grilled fish we ordered was not very good though. It was kinda salty. After eating those dishes we were still pretty hungry so we got the jumbo squid and rock shrimp ten don. Both were really good.

2.  Pork belly skewer - Also amazing.  I will be ordering this every time I come back.
3.  Grilled rice ball with homemade spicy miso  - Surprisingly really good.  I didn't expect much when one of my friends ordered two for the table, but I'd definitely order this again.
4.  Bluefin tuna cheek - Also fantastic.  Some of my friends said this was their favorite dish of everything we ordered.
5.  Sun dried sand fish - Really interesting.  It has a chewy texture and a great flavor, and comes with a really good dipping sauce.  
6.  Deep friend stingray fin - Also really interesting.  However, I wouldn't order it again unless I was bringing new people to the restaurant who had never tried stingray before.
7.  Snow crab and broccolini - Pretty good, but it's mixed with some kind of wasabi sauce, and I absolutely hate wasabi.  However, if you like wasabi and love broccolini, this is for you.
8.  Corn tempura - I normally hate corn, but this was pretty good and some of my friends loved it.
9.  Unagi liver - I hated this, but some of my friends liked it.
10.  Intestine skewer - I hated this so much that I had to spit it out.  However, some of my friends loved it so much they ordered another skewer, and I think I maybe just don't like intestine.  So if you actually do like intestine, this might be for you.",5.0

Food was very good here.Two of us ordered a little too much but then we got to try out different things.
1. Corn tempura - this is a must! It was lightly fried and combining it with the green tea salt was definitely to die for!

4. grill whole squid - one of the best that i've had. very tender and jiucy, love it!
5. homemade tofu - it was good, silky soft, but i had better.
6. grill black pork belly - this is very yummy! another ""must order"" item.
7. grill rice ball - it was alright, a bit salty. i had much better origini before.

- Chicken Karaage: Just fried chicken, but it comes with a really amazing sauce to dip with.
- Kiraku Rib: Tender, juicy, delicious spare rib.

Come during an off-hour because this place is tiny and fills up fast. There's a $12 minimum per person but if you make a reservation they raise the minimum to $30. Fantastic place to enjoy drinks and small dishes with friends.",5.0
2016,"I went there tonight.  My bf and I ordered

1) Grilled whole squid:  It was good.  The mayo it comes with tasted really good with the squid.  Without the mayo, the squid didn't taste quite as good.  As much I enjoyed it, I wont be ordering it again.  It was good but not great.

2) Beef Croquette: Best I've ever had. There's not actually any beef meat in it.  The potato was nicely mashed inside and you could taste the beef flavor.  I think broth was mixed with the potato.  It was delicious.  Other croquettes i've has at other places put cheap frozen veggies and sometimes ground beef inside and the potato is kinda flavorless.  Kiraku's croquettes are bursting with flavor.

3) Beef tongue skewers:  I loved loved loved these.  Cooked too perfection and bursting with flavor.

4) Corn Tempura:  Delicious.  The dish itself smells sweet.  The corn was very juicy and crunchy.  One of my fav dishes of the night.

5) Blue find cheek:  My least favorite dish.  It honestly tasted like just a regular fish dish you could get anywhere.  I think i'm just not a fan of the flavor of the dish.

I plan to come back here.  I want to try their udon and eat more of the beef tongue, corn tempura and croquettes.  No parking lot but if you are willing to walk a few long blocks, there is parking.  Most people who complain about parking are those who are too lazy to walk a few extra blocks.  Good service and the food came quickly.  Make a reservation or get there early to put your name on the table list at the front of the restaurant.",4.0
2012,"Ever making a point of checking out new restaurants on the rare occasions I make it out to Berkeley, my friends and I detoured from Kirala to Kiraku, turned off by the the long waits and lack of reservations at the former (that said, Kiraku only allows reservations up until the day prior).

After waiting a good half hour or so for a four-person table to open up (the wait is significantly less for parties of two), we ended up ordering:

* Agedashi Tofu - Prepared a bit differently than others I've tried (but using silken tofu!), their tofu is more deeply fried (aka crispier), and with a thicker, starchier sauce than I'm accustomed to. Nevertheless, good flavors, and enjoyable.

* Roast Duck [ flic.kr/p/doKYDv ] - I think this used to be paired with foie gras prior to the ban, but don't let that stop you from ordering this tender, flavorful, and oh-so-tasty dish.

* Osaka-Style Taro Potato (aka Taroyaki) [ flic.kr/p/doKYrr ] - Okay, I made that name up, but it describes this dish incredibly well. Imagine all the standard toppings and flavorings of takoyaki, but with balls of simmered taro instead. And while I'm not really a fan of taro, even I enjoyed this dish, though I would have preferred the taro simmered a bit longer.

* Grilled Jumbo Squid [ flic.kr/p/doKZfX ] - I'm not usually a huge fan of grilled squid due to its somewhat rubbery texture, but I suspect that is mostly a result of overcooking it. Kiraku did a great job preparing theirs, resulting in great flavor, and a mostly unrubbery, tender meat.

* Oyakodon - Among one of the better (or best) preparations I've had of this, it was neither too sweet, nor too salty, with just the right balance of flavors. I was a little concerned because some of the chicken looked a bit pink, but I'm fine, so, either the chicken was fresh, or it's just an artifact of how it's prepared.

* Buta-kim [ flic.kr/p/doKZ1P ] - Kimchi is another one of those things I'm picky about, and something I enjoy far more hot than cold. They serve theirs up in a cast-iron skillet with some slices of pork, and an egg cracked atop, making for an incredibly hearty and flavorful (albeit rather salty) dish. Went great with the oyakodon, to balance out some of the excess salt.

* Beni-otome (Sesame Seed) Shochu - I'm a sucker for trying shochu distilled from things I haven't tried before, and this was definitely new. One of my favorites to date, you can definitely taste the sesame seeds, making this a nice, smooth, shochu with great toasty, nutty flavor.

At $24 per person after tax and tip, pricing was not bad for an izakaya, especially considering how incredibly full we were afterwards.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - Not only is the venue rather small, the seating arrangements are rather compact, leaving only about a third of the available tables easily accessible, so make sure to mention the need for accessibility if calling in for reservations.

Bathroom - I didn't use them, so I can't comment, but I have my doubts about their accessibility.",4.0

2014,"Wow! This restaurant is exceptional!
Since traffic was terrible from SF to Sacramento, we stopped in Berkeley to have dinner and wait for the traffic to die down.
I almost walked away from this restaurant as there was a 20 mins wait, and I am so happy I did not.
We had a feast, everything was fantastic, but my favorite was roasted duck (which was probably the best I EVER had)
Super friendly service, since we promised to finish by 8 (set down at 7 and we were in a hurry and they needed the table) we ended up with delicious frozen yogurt and tea on the house.

2013,"Wah-hoo! My first review back on Yelp and it is of Kiraku. While there is little doubt that the ambience cannot compare to it's most direct Berkeley competitor, Ippuku, the food and service, in my opinion, do a decent job of keeping the contest close.

While it would not surprise me to have to wait at a place like Kiraku, I was seated rather quickly and given an extensive list of my servers recommendations, which was both informed and tailored to my preferences, and I ended up ordering quite a few of them.

While I begin any good evening with a beer and some sake, I also opted to order the homemade tofu and the squid as appetizers. The tofu was amazing, very soft and not overly garnished. Much better than the cookie-cutter agedashi I get at most other places. I was very impressed. Ika was also simple, but delicious.

Sadly, I went almost 3 weeks ago now, and I do not remember what else I ordered. The rock shrimp with mayo glaze were delicious, as were the duck gyoza.

Overall, a pleasant place to go with someone close, or just hang out with a few friends. I hope to come back soon!",4.0
2013,"At first I was skeptical after a coworker gave me a vague description of this restaurant. I had in my head the image of a ""fusion"" place + memories of a bad tapas experience in New Orleans.

When we walked in I saw the dishes folks ordered and I felt my mouth begin to salivate. Once I had a chance to view the menu I was completely sold.

Tonight I had:

Deep fried octopus
Boiled spinach
Garlic edamame
Cold tofu
Corn fritters
Beef tongue
Kobe beef cubes
Rock shrimp

Everything I tasted was delicious - especially the corn fritters! My absolute favorite dish was the beef tongue.

I would love to come here again and again, just to have a chance to eat everything on the menu.

Price-wise, it was great. I was expecting it to be somewhat expensive (I understand that this may be different for many people as there are differing realities concerning affordability in this world).

The service was fantastic and friendly - I left Kiraku feeling so deeply satisfied!",5.0
2013,"I've been hearing about Kiraku for a while, ever since Audrey G. (ROTD Yelper for Kiraku) had talked about it. After four ridiculous attempts, I've finally been able to try their food. With one time going on the day they were closed, one day where my friends overeaten for lunch, one day where their kitchen had issues and had to close for the night.

I called in early to see if it was packed, which is the general case for izakaya. The lady who picked up my call told me that if I want a reservation, there is a $30/person minimum. Pretty steep to an extent, but if everyone in your group were hungry, this is easy to meet. If you're not planning to eat $30, you can just walk in and wait for the next available table.

Our wait at 9pm on a Saturday wasn't too bad, probably for like 10 minutes max. The restaurant is small but roomier than most of the other izakaya I've been to. There is less of a privacy at Kiraku, alcohol + food + good friends = loud, obnoxious conversations. Some of which you don't want your table neighbors to overhear :)

Anyway, onward to the food! We ordered 3 types of skewers, American Kobe with apple sauce, pork belly, and beef intestines. Also ordered chicken cartilage, beef tongue, jumbo squid, oyako don, sweet potato brulee, and a tea blanc manger. Unlike normal izakaya, they don't offer too many skewers, and $4-5 each is quite steep. Some of the skewers were too heavy on the sauce and becomes a bit overwhelming. I liked the beef intestine one though, reminds me of the taste of pig's intestine, but with a crispier texture and more of a charcoal taste from its cooking method. Do give it a try if you're open to various Asian ingredients. The beef tongue was delicious and was just right, very juicy and tender, its sauce wasn't too overwhelming. My friend had a hard time distinguishing each dish though due to the sauce they used on almost every meat dish.

Service was definitely great. The ladies working there were extremely patient when we took our sweet time choosing this and that. Not too helpful when you ask them for recommendations. My friend wanted a recommendation on desserts and end up hearing ""everything on the menu is good.""  

Overall, even though service was pretty good, I'm not extremely fond of the food we ordered this time, I might come back another time to try more of their seafood dishes. As of now, this place has gotten too much hype and the food isn't enough to back it up.",3.0
2013,"Usually, 4 1/2 stars after 180+ reviews means that the place is out of this world.  Was here last week.  While it's good, I wouldn't say it's even 4 stars.

It's a 3.5 star place. When a place is a 3.5 star place, you ask yourself, would I come here again in the next week?  My answer to that question was ""not anytime soon.""  That's the tiebreaking answer to a question which measures the difference between a 3 star place and 4 star place.

That's not to say I didn't like it.  But I just didn't knock my socks off.

Got here late Sunday afternoon around 6pm.  No wait.  Thank god.

Service is warm, friendly, and welcoming.  No problems on the service.  Loved the heated towels delivered prior to eating.  Love shit like that.

Atmosphere is naturally lit comfort.  Excellent air circulation and a very sociable place that isn't too quiet, like a mortuary, or too loud.

The patrons here are cool too.  No loud idiots and no parents bringing kids who scream like hyanae who've stepped on needles.

The food here isn't sushi, so do not judge this as a sushi place.  It's more like a tapas/yakitori place which means: a lotta little things and not much starch.  And that's ok too.

I'm trying to remember what I had.  

--Had fried tempura corn.  It pretty much tastes like a corn fritter with a lot of salt added to it.  Addicting like popcorn, but ultimately something you regret eating after your third one.  To order this you have to buy 4 for $7.50.  They're overly filling in a bad way (i.e.simple carbs that just sit in your stomach leaving not much room for anything else);
--Pork Belly on a stick.  I can't recall how much it cost, but it was cheap, maybe $3.50 for a decent portion.  It was sinfully delicious.  Probably my favorite dish.
--Some kind of beef marrow.  Not bad. (2nd favorite dish)
--An appetizer of 3 different things, I think one was squid salad, jellyfish, and some kind of fishy thing like a flavorless ceviche.  For $9, they weren't that special;
--A ceviche dish of some sort.  It was ok.  Not horrible but didn't impress me.

I can't recall what the other dishes were, but nothing memorable.

I mean, I enjoyed the vibe of the place, but last I checked, I don't eat vibes.

2014,"Delicious! I went here with a girlfriend last night as an early celebration for her upcoming birthday and had a fantastic experience! We walked in around 10pm and were seated almost immediately. If you go to this place on a weekend, definitely go late... I've walked by here a couple of times and have seen people waiting at the door. The service quality was varying: we had different servers take our order, bring us food and give us our check and they ranged from friendly and eager to please to impatient and a little pushy. The food however was SO YUMMY! We split the tempura corn and the roast duck and I had the mini donburi, while my friend had the grilled beef tongue.

Tempura Corn with Green Tea Salt: Seriously Addictive! The corn fritter was crunchy, slightly sweet and salty. I'm normally not a huge fan of tempura but this dish was amazing. Also the Green Tea Salt was genius... it really added a lot of depth to the dish.

Roast Duck: Succulent and slightly rare. This was served as 8-10 small but thick slices. It was pretty good but didn't live up the fried goodness of the corn.

Mini Donburi: This was my second favorite dish after the corn! It had salmon, ikura, uni and real crab meat on top of jasmine rice. The dashi soy sauce that came with it went perfectly with the dish.

Grilled Beef Tongue: I didn't have this but my friend said the beef was melt-in-your mouth tender and had great flavor.

Drinks- Started off with a basic Sapporo, but after a few dishes we decided to try something new. The Koshihikari Echigo was really good!

Food- Every dish was so good and almost made me cry tears of joy, literally.

-Corn Tempura, we tried this because it sounded interesting. It was definitely a good choice. Nice and crispy w/ buttery taste.
-Beef Tataki, nice and juicy and easy to eat!
-Pork Belly Skewers, also super good! Super flavorful and the sauce they provided was icing on the cake!
-Beef Tongue w/ Garlic and Truffle Oil. Smelled as good as it tasted.. The garlic and truffle oil combined for a amazing taste.
-Maze Gohan, wasn't expecting much since we got this as a filler. We were caught off guard. This was good also, came with bits of Salmon and Ikura. Once you got a bite of all 3 at once. Delish..
-Fatty Tuna Cheek, was so good and literally melted in your mouth. Couldn't believe how amazing that was..
Roasted Duck- this Duck changed the way i'll look at duck FOREVER! It was medium rare-ish according to our waitress. It was not greasy like it usually can be and the flavor was a foodgasm, especially with the sauce it comes with. GAMECHANGER!
Last but not least,
the A5 Miyazaki Wagyu Beef Sushi, looked as good as it tasted.

All in all, it was one of those places where you wanted to eat the whole menu! Sadly, we had to stop ourselves from going overboard. The experience was amazing and the service was also excellent. Definitely would drive there from San Jose again.

Scallop sashimi varies greatly in flavor depending on where the scallops are from, how fresh they are and how they are treated after harvesting. The scallop sashimi we had here Friday was one of the two best versions I have eaten (the other being in a bar food restaurant in Japan).

I was VERY disappointed with the service, which didn't seem to know what vegetarian options there were or could be. Sushi can EASILY accommodate vegetarians with sushi rolls that don't contain meat but instead include vegetables.

But here, even the menu doesn't serve non-carnivores. WIth as much business as they do, I suppose they don't need us around, which is precisely how I felt. I sat and sat and sat, waiting for something to come that I could eat. Others ate and were satisfied. I'm sure of that, but even when my glass was down and removed from the table, I didn't get any kind of replacement drink offered for a LONG time.

First, I think the serving size of their food is actually not tiny like in other izakayas. Second, the price is really reasonable. And finally, I think they have a lot more items to select from.

We had reservations for a Friday night at 7pm. This is only possible if you promise to spend at least $30 per person and order alcohol. No problem!

Started out with the required alcohol LOL Chuhai with shochu. If you don't care for sake, and like sweet drinks, this is for you.
Then it was off to the races, er, to the food!

- Lotus roots chips: good snack, it's a huge bowl
-Corn tempura w/ green tea salt: delicious sweet salty, and huge
- salted Hamachi kama (tuna jaw): WOW amazing, grilled perfectly, perfect taste
- Sashimi salad: very good but be aware it's tiny portions of sashimi. But the flakes are unique.
- Deep Fried Fish Cakes: Ok, I would skip this
- Buta Kim (pork with kimchi): very good!
- Grilled pork belly: get one for each person.. this was another standout YUM!

2014,"Small plates of deliciousness!  I brought my friend here for his birthday.  He's the one that told me about this restaurant because his friend said it was good.

I arrived around 6:10 and waited about 30 minutes to get seated.  They open at 5:30 PM, but I decided it probably wasn't necessary to call and make a reservation.  TIP: Make a reservation anyways\

The restaurant is really small but that's okay.  It makes it really cozy.  Once we got seated, they handed us a nice, warm towel.  And handed us menus and brought water.

We ordered the following:
Deep fried chicken cartilage--it looked like cute and tiny pieces of popcorn chicken. But when you ate it, there was a tiny crunch to it because it's cartilage.  It was lightly salted and came with a lemon to squeeze on top.
Salmon carpaccio--thinly sliced salmon topped with tomatoes, onions, and fried garlic.  It was good but it basically tasted like they put salsa on top of sashimi.  So the salsa was basically $1.50 more.
Wagyu beef--this was one of their specials.  One of my favorite dishes of the night.  It came with 2 sauces but I don't know what it's called.  One was orange and the other one was white.  The orange sauce had an extremely light flavor.  The white one was my favorite and it garlic with something else.  The beef was so soft and melted in my mouth.  I definitely recommend getting this item.
Grilled scallops--this was also one of their specials.  It looks amazing.  Tastes good.  But was it worth the $15? Absolutely not.  There was nothing too special about it.  It came with pesto sauce but I thought it tasted better with the sauce from the waygu beef.
Mini donburi--this item was also one of their specials.  My other favorite dish of the night.  It was a cute little bowl of rice topped with salmon sashimi, ikura, kani, uni, and green onions.  The salmon was good; it was like the salmon from the salmon carpaccio.  The ikura and kani was also good.  My favorite was the uni.  The uni on here was amazing.

The service was great! The waitresses were all extremely nice.  They constantly refilled our water and cleared our empty dishes.

Tuna tataki. To die for. Very unique with red onion in the soy sauce.
Junmai Sake.  Overflowing shot glass, even get to drink the spillover!

Simply one of the most unique Japanese sushi places around. Only in Berkeley, right? (Even if it's technically in Oakland!) Several meat dishes on the menu, and an awesome sake menu with unique offerings like potato sake.  Small place, homey atmosphere.  I can see why the wait time can be long here.  Luckily I had an early dinner at 5:30 and got a table right away on on Wednesday.  Still had a few tables at 6:30, so midweek is the way to go. Attentive servers, she waited until I was done with my salmon before delivering the tempura corn.  That is so refreshing in itself.  Plus, I didn't felt rushed at all.",5.0
2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I came in solo and wrote my name on the wait list.  After about 40 minutes I got sat.  The service was very friendly.

This place is authentically Japanese- not Korean, Chinese or Mexicans making Japanese food.  It's as auththentic as it gets.  The staff and guests were all Japanese.  I sat next to a visitor from Japan that makes Sake.  He was very friendly and shared his sake with me.  One of the Chefs engaged me and I clued him in that I was also a Chef.

The food here is very simple.  The portions are small.  Think tapas or dim sum, but Japanese.  Its not a sushi spot, but they do sashimi.  My Kampachi was some of the freshest and cut beautifully.

I honestly cannot wait to go back.  Very legit.",5.0
2014,"Just as others have mentioned before, the wait is LONG...seriously and devastatingly long. My friend and I waited over an hour just to be seated (while I know it was our fault for not calling ahead to make a reservation, it was still a painful wait). The restaurant is pretty small, as is typical of Berkeley, and so, it makes sense that it is difficult to seat people quickly especially when it is so populated.

Which brings me to my next point: Kiraku is pretty flipping delicious. While I generally do not prefer Japanese cuisine (ERMERGERD WTF!??! Yeah, sorry, I know, I cray), I was happily shown up by Kiraku. And again, the masses have it right - get the corn tempura with green tea sea salt. It is probably one of the best things - partially because its fried, but also because its amazing and delicious! We also ordered the Buta-Kim, which has kimchee and pork. While I am still salivating over the thoughts of the corn tempura, the Buta-Kim was also pretty good. The pork was tender and well seasoned. I was not a big fan of the fried chicken, but my friend enjoyed it!  In spite of the long wait to be seated and another long wait to take our order, the food came out promptly.

I would most likely come again - though I would avoid popular dining hours to save myself from hunger pangs. Or, be smart, and call ahead. :)

Enjoy!",4.0
2014,"4.8 (meh I'll just give it a 5) stars out of 5

This place needs to be at least a Michelin recommended restaraunt. How Ippuku is and not Kiraku baffles me.

This tiny restaraunt is great in ambience and flavor. One time, my girlfriend and I went there literally like 5 minutes before closing but they still let us in and cooked for us. It was just us and the employees, drinking after a long day at work I'm sure. Such a movie scene, it was perfect.

The food is made with great detail and presentation. The Canadian pork melted in my mouth. Such wow. The tapas were delicious as some of them came with a special sauce. The pork and the sirloin tapas I highly recommend, get them!!

I do have to say though that the sake is a bit overpriced. I know some of the sake they sell as I see them at Berkeley Bowl and I can say that you'd be better off just holding off on the alcohol if you're a bit short on cash.

Overall this place is great and I will be returning from time to time. Perfect place to take visitors of the bay!",5.0
2015,"Sorry Anthony Bourdain, you need reservations when planning on Kiraku.

I would normally never give 5 stars to a place where I had to wait TWO AND A HALF HOURS (effing egregious) to get a table, but the food was excellent, and the staff at Kiraku seemed genuinely sorry about our long wait.  Once we were seated it was a 5-star experience, so I guess I'm getting soft in my old age...  (Resos apparently available to  those who will order alcohol and spend at least $30 of food per person. Uhh, not hard here.)

We let a large party in before us since there is really only one place in the small space for them to sit, so they were real champs and bought us a carafe of sake to sedate us (note: this worked).  We also got a complimentary tataki that was EXCELLENT (note: thanks Kiraku, this also worked).

As far as our actual ordering, we did well.
- Salted Hamachi Kuma: yummm - so salty and buttery.  Great.
- Sashimi sampler: 6 different cuts - ALL melt-in-your-mouth.  Honestly. Best sashimi I've ever had.
- Grilled beef tongue with truffle oil: Good and rare, but really really salty!
- Corn Tempura with green matcha tea salt: Yummy, but the fish was way better.
- Seaweed salad: Fine, good.
- Kiraku salad: Fine, didn't need it.

Get your reservation and get over there!  Otherwise, go at 5:30pm or get comfy on the Telegraph sidewalk.",5.0
2013,"Oh Kiraku! You have stolen my heart! A Japanese tapas place, with a cozy feel, Kiraku is definitely a must go to place if you're in the area.

My friends and I ordered:

1. Lotus root chips with celery salt (Nothing special. I would probably skip on this next time.)

2. Agedashi tofu (Definitely good quality and a must order if you enjoy this dish.)

3. Corn tempura with green tea salt (This was one of my favorites! Not overly fried and I loved how I could taste both the green tea salt and corn. No flavor was overpowering- such perfection!)

4. Rock shrimp ten-don (Deep fried shrimp over egg and rice. I normally am not a big fan of fried shrimp, but this was some good shrimp! The dish sounded too simple to have me satisfied, but it was so flavorful! I would definitely order this again.)

5. Seared steak (I love when the meat still has red in it. This meat was cooked just right. Right flavor, right texture...just delicious! It was totally worth a cheat meat day.)

Kiraku. Great service. Great food. Worth the prices.",4.0

2017,"I want to dock a star for the SERVICE but the food was too good. Most of the ladies too obviously didnt want to be there. The blonde girl especially i saw her side eye a customer a look annoyed by them. She seemed unhappy when taking my order. The ""i hate my life"" attitude. There is a girl with black hair who greets everyone when they came in who was much more enthusiastic and good. Best sashimi ever though. Pricey but quality seafood. Rock shrimp with mayo could have been skipped the sauce on top was good but not a lot of shrimp compred to the breading. The sashimi is SO good the pork belly too.",5.0
2015,"This is my favorite restaurant in Berkeley.

It's small, and you will likely have to wait. I wouldn't recommend trying to go with a group larger than 4.

The food is lovingly crafted, and everything is exact as it should be. The dishes are generally greatly designed, and consistently perfectly prepared. (The tapas run the gamut in terms of their tastes and textures, so you might order something that you, personally, don't like, but it will always be perfectly prepared.)

The sake tastings are great, and they take care to serve it very chilled and in cool sake glasses.

Literally, zero complaints, at all. Oh, and the service is super nice and great, too.",5.0

2016,"Okay so the only reason why they get a 4 star is merely because of the amount of time we had to wait to get our table. However it was well worth the wait. They didn't have a wine list so they let us bring our own bottle and just charged us accordingly. The food was amazing from start to finish and once you are seated and start eating they provide impeccable service. The karage chicken was my favorite of the night. This place is amazing. Best Japanese food in Berkeley/Oakland area. Get there early so you don't have to wait long but if you do have to wait, it is worth it.",4.0
2015,"Have dined here twice now and each time had to wait an hour to be seated but I can't complain because the food and service is definitely worth it.  If you prefer not to wait you can make a reservation online but I believe there is a 30 dollar per seat minimum for reservations.

Great place for friends obviously as its a tapas joint. Food is fresh and service is great.  The staff is well versed on the menu for a mid priced restaurant. I got great advice on drinks and loved everything they recommended.  Expense wise, it can get up there if you're having fun but its nothing outrageous at all.  

Had one of the best dinner experiences I've had in the bay area at this place.  Don't let the wait time deter you. In my opinion, one of the best restaurants in east bay and definitely my go to for Japanese.  Also good for hosting out of town friends.",5.0

2014,"Kiraku is a great izakaya place and hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley. Their menu is on the pricier side, especially compared to other establishments near campus, but the food is definitely worth it! Hungry college kids, beware--don't come here expecting to get full unless you're willing to spend more than $25/person.

I have yet to order something at Kiraku that I didn't like. I highly recommend the Spicy Jellyfish and Black Cod. Their sashimi is always fresh.

2012,"The best way I can describe this place is a Japanese tapas restaurant and the prices weren't as expensive as I thought they would be.
The ramen was decent. Soy based soup and noodles.
The chilean sea bass ceviche was pretty good and not too lemony was the Peruvian ceviche. The ceviche was delicious but I was kind of confused since the fish was cooked, not raw.
The organic chicken karaage was probably my favorite dish. Juicy pieces of fried chicken with a mayonaise sauce. Just delicious!
The sweet potato brulee was a nice end to our meal. I could taste the sweet potato and I didn't think it was too sweet.",4.0
2014,"This is pretty much our favorite restaurant in the area. Consistently impeccable execution makes paying around ten bucks for small dishes very much worth it, and I'm a real cheapskate.

At this point I think we've tried most things in the menu, and while some are better than the others, we rarely had a dud. As a general rule though, I would recommend cooked dishes over sashimi, not because their sashimi isn't good (it is), but because in my mind their fried and grilled dishes really showcase their attention to detail. Chicken Karaage is always excellent and filling, and so is the grilled squid. Their Hamachi Kama, when they had it, was also really nicely done. I like their Buta Kakuni with a runny egg, and their roasted duck and beef tongue dishes (while pricey) are very good also. Even something extremely simple like Yaki Onigiri is served with a small serving of an interesting veggie side, instead of the usual piece of yellow daikon.

To nitpick, I wish their sake wasn't so pricey, and while they have generally good consistency, I've seen some variations in the size of the grilled squid, as well as the quality and quantity of fish in sashimi salad. And.. that's about it. If you like Japanese pub food, this place is definitely worth seeking out. In the Bay Area, the only other Izakaya style restaurant that we think is comparable to Kiraku is Izakaya Sozai in SF. Go early when they open at 5:30, and you don't need reservation. Highly recommended.",5.0

I really enjoy the fact that they keep the menu lively and update based on whats season it is. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. You have a very traditional selection of Japanese dishes. Some of my favorites are the simpler items on the menu like nasu miso, stewed oxtails,and Nankotsu karate......the chief is amazing.

2013,"The two stars is for my experience from the other night. We came here for my friends birthday dinner and had reservations, but when we all got there, we were not able to be seated until a good thirty minutes later.

I have to say that the food itself is very good, and left all of us full and satisfied. We ordered a lot of different options: corn tempura, salmon sashimi, chicken karage (one of my favorites), black cod, saba shio, and roasted duck...among so many others that I can't remember off the top of my head right now!

Also for a place with not very many staff, the service was decent, and I never had to ask for my water glass to be refilled because they were always on top of it. For the most part, they were also very friendly and tried to be accommodating despite the initial wait.

So why the two stars? I've definitely tried better izakaya style places in the area, like Ippuku which is not too far away from this location. We were also served dirty bowls, not just with like remnants of food that didn't get washed away, like a full bowl that just never got washed. Although they were apologetic about it, I just couldn't help but wonder about the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.

We also had issues with paying. Since we wanted to split the bill, they didn't let us split with card and cash, so we had to pick one. They also don't take Amex.",2.0
2014,"I would say it's on my top 3 list of Berkeley favorite izakaya places. It has lots of authentic interesting ingredients on their menu. Also they have special menus everyday. I would say the only downside is that it is a little bit pricy ($25-$30 per person without drinks).

Food (4.5/5)

- Baby Squid (4.5/5): It's super fresh and you should pair it with Junmai Sake. It's literally the perfect match.
- Spicy Jellyfish (3.5/5): It's a traditional Chinese appetizer, pretty good, but nothing special.
- Sashimi combo (4.5/5): You should always get the daily special combo if you are a sashimi person. I love sashimi and have a really high standard for it. It's super fresh!
- Corn Tempera (4.5/5): Almost everyone will order this for their first time visit cuz it's a really creative dish and tastes super delicious.
- NASU MISO, Globe Eggplant w/ Miso (5/5): This is probably my top 3 favorite dish at Kiraku cuz I really like Eggplant and the miso sauce pairs with it perfectly. I would suggest 4 people split this dish. The second time we ordered this dish, it was for two people. I felt it's a little bit too much.
- Salmon Carpaccio (5/5): Very fresh and with a couple sides and sauce on top of the salmon, the flavor is complicated but balanced well.
- Roasted Duck Kiraku Style (5/5): I love duck and had a lot good ones before. Kiraku's duck is really tender and juicy. The sauce pairs with the duck perfectly.
- Cartilage (4.5): Crispy and juicy, i love the connective tissue part.
- Grilled Pork Belly with miso sauce (3.5/5): I love pork belly but I would say I prefer the pork belly at Kbbq's place. Compare to other interesting dishes at Kiraku, this one is too normal.
- Ramen (2/5): Decent but nothing special. I wouldn't waste my money for this.
- Roasted Tea Blanc-manger (5/5): Definitely my FAVORITE dessert! Not only cuz the flavor is really good, but also I think it's prefect after so many completely different flavors' appetizers and main dishes, this dessert kinda serves like the palate cleanser, perfect ending for your dinner.
- Green Tea Ice Cream with Warabi Mochi (4/5): I like warabi mochi. Besides that, nothing special.

Service (4/5)

The waitress there are all pretty cute and super nice. They give good recommendation for food and drinks. Make sure to make a reservation beforehand, especially for weekends' dinner and week days after 7pm.

Ambience (4/5)

Good for small party or couples. It is a little bit noisy. Have a good selection for Japanese alcohol. Make sure to ask for the chef for alcohol choice to pair with your dishes.

Dishes came out at a consistent pace, and we enjoyed every single one. Highlights included the hamachi kama, saba shio, oyako-don, and the corn tempura - very fresh and flavorful dishes.

The dinner service itself was good, with waters being refilled quickly and friendly waitresses. Unfortunately, the place suffers from some disorganization. Reservations incur a $30 minimum spend and require the purchase of alcohol with your meal. We didn't have a problem with this, but such a policy made it seem like the reservation held a higher level of importance than normal and I was accordingly disappointed when our entire party showed up on time, only to be denied being seated for half an hour (we didn't start eating until almost an hour after our reservation time). No attempt to help make up for the situation, such as an offer of a complimentary beverage or dessert, etc was made. We were also given a dirty stack of bowls (they still had uneaten food in it, so they were probably just cleared from another table). While not terrible, these issues did make our experience not as enjoyable as it could have been.",3.0

Something people should definitely know is that this place serves tapas so the plates are SMALL. No joke. The waitress basically explained that people usually order multiple dishes and share them all.

My group ordered the Kiraku Rib (it came with 4 measly pieces of meat for $9), Salmon Sashimi (delicious and fresh, slightly seared!), Oyako-Don, Rock Shrimp Ten Don, and Balsamico Pork. Everything was delicious, no complaints on taste. But honestly, for a $60 tab, the amount of food we got could probably only feed 2 people. The pork plate was probably the saddest little thing because one of myhungrier friends ordered it thinking he would be full.......think again. 3 stars for the taste and service; I don't htink I could give it anything higher because I was still so hungry after.

2014,"After having lived in Japan, it is very disappointing to have such limited options on what Japanese food is offered here in the states. While we have found excellent sushi, and the ramen craze has made it easier to find that as well, izakaya type dishes are far more difficult to come by.

We came here this summer for my birthday. And again last week on the way home from our honeymoon. It hasn't failed yet.

Every dish is done well. And I love the regional highlights. I had a small preference for the menu over the summer, but that is showing casing seasonal eating, so it is worth it.

Highlighted dishes: albacore yuzu ceviche, lotus chips, corn tempura, and shime saba. Least favorite dishes: bone marrow (should be served with rice or a carbohydrate to soak it up), and seasonally smoked pickles (too heavily smoked).

We have heard Ippuku is just as good, but we have had a hard time pulling away from Kiraku to give it a try.",5.0
2015,"Highlights:
- The food is excellent. We ordered 10 dishes and all were exceptional, however portions are small given the style of Japanese tapas. The tempura corn fritters and homemade tofu are must-haves; so delicious, you'll leave the restaurant wanting more. The black cod was like butter -- so rich and cooked to perfection, it nearly melted in our mouths.
- Ambiance is quaint, cute and bustling. Not recommended for families with small children or babies.
- Service is great; the staff are friendly and helpful and they certainly hustle to ensure that patrons are attended to, and that the dishes are delivered hot and in a timely manner.

Lowlights:
- Somewhat pricey for what you get; don't expect to leave the restaurant with a full stomach.

Tip:
- Make reservations or arrive early to get seated. We were fortunate enough to lock in same-day reservations for 5:15 PM. Upon arriving to the restaurant around 5PM, there was a line of about 15 people waiting to be seated.

We ordered:
-Corn Tempura with green tea salt (my least favorite but my gf enjoyed it)
-Wagyu Titaki beef (On the rarer side but I personally don't mind. Whatever sauces this was dressed with, along with the onions, contributed to the excellency)
-Beef Tongue with truffle oil (Again, this was rarer than expected and was pretty chewy. But still the truffle oil made this taste amazing)
-Salmon Sashimi (really thin slices, but incredibly fresh and buttery)
-Sashimi plate with salmon, red snapper and bluefin tuna (All delicious)
-Grilled Squid (Cooked perfectly that it wasn't too chewy. The soysauce that was drizzled on it was a tad salty but the mayonaisse on the side balanced it)
-Green tea ice cream with mochi (Heaven in your mouth!)

2014,"I split my weekend dinners between Kiraku and Ippuku in Berkeley and I love both places equally.  Each establishment has its own uniqueness when it comes to their food.  Here are some of the dishes I tried at Kiraku:
- A5 Miyazaki beef, the best steak that I've ever had. I prefer my steak prepared with lime salt. This steak truly melts in your mouth and the maitake mushroom complement the steak perfectly.  Two ounces of this goodness cost $45.00, but that is money well spent.
- Roasted bone marrow, this is a must-have item.  Some may say roasted bone marrow is an acquired-taste type of food but I believe it is highly addictive.  The bone marrow texture is silky soft and its flavor is extremely delicate.  Don't miss out on this an amazing dish as you may not find it elsewhere!
- Home-made tofu, I always like tofu, yet I never thought tofu could be this good.  This is a simple dish that goes a long way and is perfect to start your meal with.
- Sashimi special combination of the day, one of the best sashimi and the presentation is just beautiful.  It is a bit pricey at approximately $18.00 per plate (contains 9 pieces of three different kinds of fish) but the quality justifies the cost.
- Wagyu beef tataki, thinly sliced beef that practically melts in your mouth.  If you don't mind your beef rare, this is a dish for you.
- Roasted beef tongue in truffle oil, a bit chewy, it was just an okay.  I was curious about how beef tongue would taste like, and I no longer have the desire to explore further.
- Corn tempura with green tea salt, this is a kid friendly dish.  Sweet corn sprinkled with tea salt is a nice combination of flavors.
- Rock shrimp tempura, it was not what I expected.  The shrimp tempura was soaked in a special spicy mayo sauce and I did not really like this dish at all.
- Large Hokkaido squid, it comes with teriyaki sauce and is a very tasty and fulfilling dish.  However, I prefer the Hokkaido squid dish at Ippuku much more (Ippuku prepares it with a smoky flavor and without the teriyaki sauce).  
- Chicken cartilage, I can go without this dish but it happens to be my dinner partner's favorite.
- Deep-fried sting ray fins, just like the beef tongue dish, I was curious enough to try but will not have this dish again.  It was flavorless and a bit too oily.
- Pork belly skewers, a little too salty for my taste.  I prefer the pork belly skewers at Ippuku over this one.
- Roast tea blanc manger, don't end your dinner without this amazing dessert, it is one of the reasons I keep coming back to Kiraku.",4.0
2015,"After reading all the rave reviews on this place, I bookmarked this place before finally getting around to trying it this past weekend. My dad had driven me up from LA to move back in to my place before school started and he was craving sushi. Kirala had a ridiculous wait and we got lucky and just happened to be right around Kiraku at 5:30 when they opened (and good thing we did because about 20 minutes later there was already a 3 person wait list). I just have to say that this place was pretty damn good! My dad had never tried tapas style eating and so was worried we would never get full before ordering one of everything but we were pretty satisfied with everything we ordered:

1. sashimi sampler: sashimi menu changes day to day and there's no official sampler on the menu but the waitress was kind enough to hook us up. Came with 4 slices of salmon belly, 3 slices each of 3 different kinds of white fish that I can't remember off the top of my head. All the fish was incredibly fresh and I had never tried 2 of the kinds of white fish raw before (and I've been to many a sashimi place). Only downside was that they sliced it incredibly thin (which felt like a rip off. But considering it IS a Japanese restaurant it's to be expected).

2. sashimi salad: asked for the dressing on the side since restaurants always overkill. Also delicious but pretty much a standard sashimi salad.

3. shime saba: seared mackerel sashimi - to die for! so fresh and comes with mashed ginger to offset that incredibly delicious but powerful mackerel flavor

4. hamachi kama- yellowtail collar - my favorite to order at sushi places. Also very fresh and delicious, but rather small

5. off the daily menu: forget the name of the plate but basically its broccoli in an iron skillet with anchovy and garlic. As a garlic lover, I loved this dish and was a perfect ending to my rather protein filled meal up until that point.

I also saw a grilled squid going to another table that looked delish and want to try next time.

Overall: great, fresh ingredients creatively combined in these little dishes that are packed with great flavor. Only downside, I feel like it's pricier than it needs to be and when I asked the server for ginger with the sashimi he rather rudely responded with, ""We're not a sushi restaurant. We don't carry ginger.""",4.0
2014,"The Japanese tapas at Kiraku were wonderful. Although the flavors found in Japanese cuisine are usually subtle and layered, I would describe those at Kiraku as varied and intense.

Everything we had was delectable.The beef and pork belly skewers were fabulous. The cold plate appetizer plates with pickles and squid was great. The jellyfish was well balanced but the quality of the cut is not what you would find at a Cantonese seafood restaurant. The udon was very unique with a rich and flavorful pesto sauce. Everyone also loves the Japanese omelette. The salmon sashimi was top notch.

I would generally stick with ordering many small dishes rather than going for their larger plates. We ended up over-ordering (and over spending). But our stomachs were happy.

Warning: there's always a line so come early or come late.",5.0
2017,"Delicious and creative Japanese comfort food. In my opinion, this is the best Japanese joint in Berkeley!!",5.0
2013,"I came here after seeing the high rating on yelp and in deprivation of Japanese food. As the menu was handed to us, I realized that this was not a normal Japanese restaurant. There was only one kind of ramen to order and limited choices to other foods. In fact almost all of the dishes did not include rice, and I was appalled. NO RICE? How are Asians supposed to eat then?

Anyways I finally settled on the oyako don which was rice, mushrooms, onions, and egg all cooked together and then put onto rice. Now I've tried this dish several times at different places and I must say hands down, this oyako don was one of the best I've eaten. The egg was cooked just right and the proportions to the rice were even. The right amount of saltiness was added to have a prefect balance of taste and rice in every bite. It comes with spicy chili powder, but the flavor was enough without it. Overall, something I would definitely come back to eat in the future. HOWEVER, the proportions weren't all the great. It came in a small rice bowl, barely able to feed even a half full boy. Despite that, it still tasted delicious. Now I also tried a bit of my friend's buta-kim with a side of rice. It was really good, despite it having only 3 pieces of meat that my friend claimed.

Now aside from all these good tasting foods, there is one thing short from a possible 5 star restaurant. on the front door of the store holds a paper in which in red writing says ""12 DOLLAR MINIMUM PER PERSON"". Now it's so small basically I could not find it even if I tried. Now we were in a group of 5 and so we were actually 14 dollars short and they forced us to order another 14 dollars worth of food. In the end we argued our way out, but didn't end on great terms.

In the end, be careful, there is a small 12 dollar per person sign out front. So if you don't wanna waste money remember so. Despite that, definitely worth checking out as the food was superb.",4.0

Finally we got a chance to meet and it was completely love at first bite. There isn't a thing on the menu that I was 'meeh' about. The mixture of every food item has a great balance balsamic and pork, daikon and foie gras, green tea salt and corn. FANTASTIC.

2016,"This place was unbelievable. We have been home for 2 hours and we are still talking about how good the food was. So I thought it opened at 5pm. We arrived at maybe 5:10pm. The door was opened, but they said they weren't going to be open for another 12 minutes. We were the only ones sitting inside, a line was beginning out front. When it was 5:32pm, the first thing the lady asked to the crowd was if there were any reservations. No? Okay, then she began seating people off the list that was hanging outside. So, being our first time, I thought they already were aware we were the first ones there since we were inside, but the seated two tables from the line of people outside and ignored us. So, I stopped the lady and made sure she was aware that we were here. She seated us immediately after. Moral of the story? Reservations.
So we started off with the Corn Tempura, The Wagyu Beef Tataki, Suzuki Carpaccio, Black Cod (for our 3 year old son), THE BONE MARROW and sashimi chef special. We also had a sampler of the (daiginjo). Everything was just so amazing. We were already going nuts for the bone marrow. We ordered a second corn tempura and bone marrow. Our time was running out (we had to clear out before their 7pm reservation). We finished off with the Tea Blanc Manger and Grapefruit Yogurt Ice Cream. Everything was delish, we can't wait until we have visitors so we can go back!",5.0
2013,"Kiraku is one of the most exciting and innovative Japanese restaurants in the Bay Area. It's completely unassuming and the decor is pretty plain, but you can instantly tell from the constantly out-the-door lines that there's something special here. I love everything about Kiraku -- the service is phenomenal (the owners are such sweet people), the ingredients are incredibly fresh, and the dishes are wildly inventive yet somehow seems to maintain such a strong sense of authenticity that they should definitely not be considered ""fusion fare.""

I've been to Kiraku so many times now that my list of favorite dishes extends much longer than I'm able to type, but just know that it's really hard to go wrong here. The sashimi is unbelievably fresh, so make sure you throw in some sashimi slices into your order (Amberjack, Black Throat, Salmon, Toro, etc.). The Braised Kurobuta Pork is incredibly tender, the Amberjack Kama (Collar) is delicious, the Tempura Corn is perfectly crispy, and it really just goes on and on. The more you eat here, the more you'll be able to pick out your personal favorites, since there are just so many items on the menu.

My personal addiction here is their Fried Chicken Cartilage. It's super simple, but they just cook it so perfectly. It's seasoned and breaded so well that it's tough to imagine that something so easy could be so addictively delicious. Of course, you'd have to love the crunchy-meets-rubbery texture of chicken cartilage to really appreciate this awesome dish.

Make sure you end your meal with Kiraku's subtly-sweet, perfectly-textured Sweet Potato Creme Brulee.

With all of the incredible restaurants in the Berkeley area, Kiraku stands out because it has fresh, delicious Japanese food that's genuinely innovative and prepared so intricately. It's definitely one of the very best restaurants in the Bay Area.",5.0
2011,"I have, for all intents and purposes, given up writing on yelp. I rarely feel inspired by most places (not enough to make me want to write about it later). More than that, working in the restaurant industry for quite some time has made me less inclined to review other restaurants in my off time. That's just how it is.

But I feel so completely compelled to tell everyone about Kiraku, a new izakaya in Berkeley that only opened a month ago. The setting is not elegant. It's straight forward in a restaurant space that only seats about 30 people. They have a decent shochu and sake selection, the service is attentive and friendly, but their food is definitely what shines the most in their restaurant.

I would hesitate to describe the food as Japanese since it is not traditional japanese fair. Similarly, I can't call it fusion because it is not the pretentious ideas of fusion we have in the United States. It is decidedly  Japanese because the food uses all the same odd fusion techniques and ideas that have been used in  Japan for years.

The plating and presentation of every dish is superb. This is certainly a restaurant where you eat with your eyes first, but the rest does not disappoint. I've been there twice and have tried probably 1/3 of the menu (this is not a small menu... the first time i just came with a party of 12 people for my going away party...)

Every dish is excellent, but there are some particularly interesting standouts. We've had the fried ginko nuts, the fried garlic, both types of eggplant, hamachi collar, pork with kim chi, oxtail, sashimi, yaki udon, etc. Everything is plated beautifully. Everything is excellent (and for me, the oxtail was the weakest dish). They even have french fries, and the french fries are damn good.

The best dishes I've tried so far (by far) are the pickled octopus in wasabi, the boiled baby octopus, agedashi nasu, and really super fantastic shark cartilage in ume sauce . The shark is my favorite because it's so salty, sour and crunchy all at the same time. It's perfect drinking food and it's not something I could find anywhere else. They even have seared foie gras with daikon. That's so luscious and unexpected and even though I was super full by the time that arrived, I had to eat it because it's foie gras. You have to eat it.

Tonight was the first time I had dessert. We ordered all 3 desserts, including a sweet potato creme brulee, green tea ice cream with warabi mochi and a red tea pana cotta. All were excellent but the pana cotta is so amazingly good. It's not too sweet, the tea is subtle and the additions of coarse anko, whipped cream, tapioca are absolutely perfect.

I'm sad to be moving away from the bay area soon, but I'm glad I got to discover this place before I did. It's amazing, and i hope they do well for many years to come.",5.0
2016,"This is a review of their awful customer service. First time trying this restaurant and liked the good reviews from Yelp. I left a VM asking for a reservation, somebody just called me to advised me that because I was using their reservation system I had to expend thirty dollars per person ......what? Why if I don't liked the food I asked her, she said well we will give you a gift card WTF.., a gift card for what? For another restaurant? I guess the reason is because they are very small if that the case  don't do reservations...that's it! But this rule sucks and I never heard something like this. I will never ever eat there!

2014,"Wow. One of the best meals I've ever had.

I'm not an expert on Japanese food but I do eat it quite often.

We were really hungry and nervous that the ""small plates"" style would leave us wanting more. We ordered 2-3 small plates per person and were actually quite full even a few dishes in. More filling than it looks!

Food:
-All of the fresh fish was superb.
-The ribs were delicious and tender.
-The homemade tofu was unusual to my tastes and delicious.
-For something refreshing and light, the cucumber with miso dipping sauce was amazing.
-The only dish we didn't like were the taro potatoes. The taro was bland and the sauce had a smokey flavor that neither I or my two friends liked.
-The chicken udon was only ok. Not worth your time considering the other options.

-You will wait a long time but it will be worth it.
-The place is funky and comfortable inside.

But the highlight for me was the mini-donburi: it's served in  a bowl with steamed rice, salmon sashimi, snow crab, sea urchin, ikura with green onion garnish.

2017,This is hands down the best Japanese Izakaya restaurant in the Bay Area. I've been coming to this place for several years and the food quality is consistently excellent each and every time. They are busy and it's small so reservations are absolutely a must or expect to wait for 1-2 hrs depending on the day. The roasted beef tongue in truffle oil is one-of-kind. Incredibly tender and delicious. We typically order 2- one for my wife and I and another for our kids.,5.0
2011,"The service here is superb like any new place. We were waited on by several servers, all of them eager. The chef even came out to talk to us. We got hot hand towels too. The menu items are pretty unique. There are some noodle entrees in addition to all the tapas dishes. The kimchi was super pickled, but I don't know if this is housemade or not. The tempura corn with green tea salt was good. The salt was flaky and very salty indeed, but only the faintest taste of green tea. The dashi broth in my chazuke was bland. It only came dressed with nori, arare, and salmon. The vegetarian version comes with plum instead of salmon. There is only one ramen here and it had a piece of chasu, fish cake, half an egg, and some veggie. It didn't really hit the izakaya feel for me.",3.0
2014,"This place never disappoints! I've been here about 5-6 times now and although it can be pricy for the amount of food you get, the food is so good, I think its worth it (especially for a nicer occasion).

Tonight, the bf brought me here to treat me for an early birthday :) seating was very close to another 2-top so there wasn't much privacy, so it was a bit awkward when the couple next to us were in the middle of a breakup...we tried to ignore it and focus on the food instead.

We ordered:
-dried sardine sheets: pretty good app, not as fishy as I expected and it was very light and tasty
-grilled beef tongue: delicious!! Crispy and caramelized on the outside, sweet and so good!

-Osaka style taro potato: I get this every time I'm here, so its safe to say its one of my favorite dishes here. Nice smokey flavor from the bonito flakes, taro is cooked perfectly...so good we ordered 2 this time!

-homemade yuba- came with roe and uni; I'm not usually a fan of uni but this dish changed my mind! The yuba, roe and uni went so well together I wish I had another spoonful!

-black stripe bass carpaccio- really good, spice was just right and the bass was really fresh. Ordered this because they ran out of the scallops

-pork kakuni- really tasty, egg was cooked to a perfect soft boil and the pork was really tender and rich

-rock shrimp ten-don- really yummy! Rock shrimp were a bit soggy but still had a small crunch. It went really well with the egg, eggplant and rice and was a great way to fill our stomachs at the end of the meal.

Had a great experience and the wait staff was very nice and attentive as per usual. What I have also gotten in the past that I recommend: corn tempura and buta kim. Other stuff I haven't found as memorable (like the kiraku duck, duck pot stickers, chicken kaarage, rock shrimp w/mayo and the fries).

Just a couple of tips: they used to also have bone marrow here but we talked to our waitress tonight who said their supplier unfortunately stopped producing them :( so no more bone marrow here!

If you want to make reservations, be aware that there is a $30 minimum for each person, so it might be better to walk in and just wait it out if there are several parties before you.",5.0
2011,"How's this for high praise?

My wife has eaten here twice and says it is her second favorite Japanese restaurant outside of Japan (her first being Yulala tripadvisor.com/Restaura…).

I have to agree that the food was amazingly good, especially for the price. We ordered eight items, and a shared a glass of sake, and made it out for under $80.

We started with tempura enoki mushroom (I think it was enoki), and grilled fava beans. Both served with a small dish of flavored salts for dipping.

The grilled meats (we had duck and pork) were simple but outstanding and we savored each bite of the generous portions.

My wife enjoyed the baby squid (I wasn't prepared for fermented seafood at the time), and the fried ginko seeds would perfectly accompany a beer or sake. The balsamico pumpkin threw us both for a loop....Cold, sweet and soft. But it was refreshing after so much meat and fried food.

Lastly, the yuzu udon, with delicious, fresh yuzu zest. It really finished the meal off well.

We look forward to returning as often as possible.",5.0
2013,"Ambiance: It's pretty small inside, but the food is definitely five stars! It's my favorite Japanese place in Berkeley so far.

Food: The tapas were delicious and well-flavored. They are a bit pricey for the college budget but definitely worth the splurge. We ordered the corn tempura, kimchi pork belly, salmon carparccio, lamb ribs, and the roasted tea blanc-manger for dessert. Every dish had great texture and flavor, and not too salty. The corn tempura was especially impressive. I usually don't like tempura because they tend to get a bit soggy and they feel too greasy in the stomach. However, the corn tempura was completely crisp on the outside, not soggy at all, and the corn inside was very sweet and tender.  The salmon carparccio had a yummy sauce on it and was probably my second favorite.

Service: They bring out the food relatively fast for a filled restaurant, and the waiters are very considerate.",5.0

And our dessert was Yuku mochi and sweet potato Brulee was awesome.  I wasn't crazy about the octopus like everyone else.  It was good and I usually love grilled octopus,  but it didn't do it for me.  In particular I really enjoyed the sea food dishes.

2015,"A 74-year old Japanese woman introduced me to this place. It is packed. Mostly with young Asian 20 somethingers. And then a table or two or three of Japanese folks in their 50s, 60s and 70s.

The approach is Izakaya--a Japanese drinking establishment. That means tasty bites and a great selection of beverages abound.

So one way to approach dining here is what do you want to drink? Beer? Shochu (Japanese version of vodka)? Sake? Whiskey? You can even have a bottle keep--buy a bottle; they will put your name on it for those who can treat this place as their neighborhood watering hole.

When it is on the menu, the bone marrow is a must have.

There are usually two to three sashimi options a night; some excellent beef tataki. Some seasonal specialities. Things run from $4 to $18.

All the usual favorites: age dashi dofu; grilled items; ramen, ochazuke.  And there is plenty of crossover for folks not comfortable with this style of Asian food; tasty karage (fried chicken) or popcorn shrimp.  

Great for a group of four to six folks, because then you can really explore the menu.

And don't skip dessert. The blanc mange is a personal favorite, but all the desserts are an excellent note to end a fine meal.",5.0

I never thought having a visit trip to the win cellar would turn out to be a great spontaneous foodie night adventure. A gem in a wall! Kiraku serves delicious, unique and beautiful Japanese tapas you won't find at any regular Japanese restaurants.

When the server hand us the menu and told us what the daily specials was for the night I was excited that my mind felt like it ran a marathon. So many things to choose so many unique dishes to try. Yet we only ended up making a small dent on the menu ordering things to try.

We start off with the homemade tofu. Definitely different and you can actually taste and imagine in your mind the process of how it's made. Next we had the special sashimi combo. It was divine! So fresh so different then other sashimi places that words cannot describe the texture, taste and appearance that you have to see and taste it for yourself. We then tried the salmon carpaccio, waygu tataki, Tempura corn with green tea salt, Lastly we had the deep fried stingray fin and halibut with plum sauce.

corn butter - absolutely fantastic, creamy and crunchy
lotus roots chips - unique taste, thin, crispy
hamachi kama - well cooked hamachi with good flavor
agedashi tofu - flavorful and good for groups
jumbo squid -average, nothing special
cartilage - really crunch and oily

2011,"Thank you Berkeley for finally opening an authentic and delicious izakaya that served a good selection of Japanese beers and spirits. Portion sizes and prices are typical of most izakaya's, which means small-medium plates for around $5-8 each. As with most izakaya's that I have been too, I recommend coming during dinner/happy hour with a good-sized group of friends so that you can order/try a lot more food. Try to stray away from generic Japanese dishes like agedashi tofu that you can find elsewhere. Izakaya's are known for having inspired small dishes for sharing, that are typically unique to each restaurant. Their menu are updated every now and then; personally, I don't think you can go wrong with anything that sounds unique and interesting to you. My favorites have been:

-Salmon Carpaccio: BEAUTIFUL presentation, wonderful balance of acidic and rich flavors, fish was fresh, sweet and perfectly cut
-ButaKim: Stewed pork belly in kimchi with poached egg. This will make your taste buds explode, so I recommend NOT starting with this
-Shrimp Mayo: reminds of chinese walnute prawns but still delicous
-Omelet Salad: interesting take on okonomiyaki
-Jumbo Squid: succulent, not chewey, a good bite to it
-All 3 Dessets!! My friends and I kind of went crazy and decided to order/share all three desserts offered at Kiraku, all of which were unique and delicious. The 3 are: Roasted Tea Blanc-Mange, Sweet Potato Brulee
Green Tea Ice Cream with Warabi Mochi (MUST GET)

We really wanted ramen so we came here for ramen even though they're known for their tapas. I guess there arn't too many options for ramen besides ryowa in the east bay. Their ramen was okay, definitely not the same as what you would find at a ramen-only shop, but it was decent. We also tried their chicken karaage which was very good!

2016,"If you are interested in having a reservation somewhere, this isn't the place. I started calling 8 days before date that I was trying to make a reservation. I missed the first call back and they wouldn't pick up when I called back (so I left message number two). They never responded to message number two. So a few days later I left message number three. Two days after that I got a return message asking me if I was aware of their minimum order policy. The same policy that I was forced to listen to every time I left a message. So yes, I'm well aware of the policy and had planned  to order much more than the minimum. So I call back again, leave my fourth message saying yes, I understand the policy, please call me back and confirm the reservation. The next call that I get is one saying sorry, we are already booked at that time, you can come at 8:30 instead. Clearly they had zero interest in my business as they knew for 8 days that I was trying to make a reservation and preferred to give the time away to someone else. Great service! I won't be wasting any time or money at this place. There are lots of restaurants out there with great food that actually want business and don't play games with reservations.",1.0

2011,"Foie. Gras. Daikon.

Modern Japanese cooking is much more than your run-of-the-mill tonkatsu and sashimi. Through the ages Japanese cooks have embraced ingredients and styles of many different lands (check out the origins of Japanese curry, or the etymology for ""tempura""), with the results being the delicious dishes like the ones served at this restaurant.

Creative French-inspired dishes, friendly staff, fantastic sake / shochu selection, reasonable prices. The decor is somewhat pedestrian, but it just makes it easier to make it a part of the regular circuit.

In the East Bay, there is a renaissance of Japanese dining in progress: Combine with Ippuku (Berkeley) and B-Dama (Oakland) for the trifecta.",5.0

Great vibe and a perfect size to keep an intimate setting, though I'm sure 5-10 more seats would do them wonders.

Everything on the menu is pretty dam good.  My favs include:

-Beef tongue with truffle oil
-Bone Marrow
-Black Miso Cod
-Chicken Karage
-Homemade Tofu
-Rock Shrimp

They have a decent selection of sake and beer.

2016,"I really enjoy this restaurant. However, their reservation policy discriminates against individuals who do not consume alcohol.  They won't give you a reservation unless everyone in your party orders alcoholic beverages.  There are many reasons, socially, religiously, legally and medically why an individual cannot or will not consume alcohol. I understand the concept of an izakya but if we exceed the minumum per person  ($30) to make a reservation, I don't understand a policy where we are forced to ""enjoy their alcoholic selection.""   What are the pregnant women, under-aged, recovering alcoholics, or people who simply make a life choice to not drink alcohol expected to do?",2.0
2013,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. :)
It's a small place, so sometimes it can be super crowded, especially when all of the Japanese business people go there after work. A little pricey, but it's expected for a tapas style restaurant, and for the food quality and overall deliciousness, it's worth it.

I'm a sucker for noodles and I love both of their udon dishes (the pesto udon and the yuzu chicken udon). There is a seasonal menu as well, and as a rule of thumb, you should always get at least one item from there :D Also really like their corn tempura, and the grilled squid.  Dessert wise, I'd go for the roasted tea...thingy, or the grapefruit ice cream :D This is one of the places I always want to visit any time I'm back in Berkeley.",5.0
2012,"This place is comparable to Ippuku, though I do like the quality of Ippuku better and they have a more unique dining experience there. However, the food here is still very good and worth a try!

Marinated octopus with wasabi - portion is extremely small. it's like one of those dipper plates you get at dim sum. but, the flavor is overwhelming unique with the strong wasabi presence and hint of vinegar marinate. i really enjoyed it and the small portion makes you want to savor it more.
Buta kim - so so. you can get better krn food at a krn restaurant. the beef tongue is pretty tender though.
Chicken gizard - don't recommend bc it's not well cooked. overly deep fried and not much flavor.
Sweet potato brulee - really really good and unique. good texture, esp using sweet potato to substitute the consistency of creme brulee. def worth a try!",4.0
2014,"High quality, authentic, fresh, and tasty are the words I'd use to describe the food here.  Having traveled to Japan many times over, this is one of the few places locally I've seen actually replicate the food, flavors, and even ambiance.

Regarding the food, I don't have any particularly standout item, it was all just very good and balanced.  In many ways that's the essence of Kiraku and Japanese food.  Sure some dishes were better than others, and their homemade tofu was some of the best I've *ever* tried (and I'm quite the carnivore), but the key here is balance.

If I can give any advice on ordering (since you simply must come), it's to *not* come with a checklist in mind (counterintuitive - I know), and instead build your order with a variety of elements. The staff is very knowledgeable and I felt, unlike many other places, helped us order exactly the right amount of food for our group.  

Can't wait to come back!",5.0
2011,"I came here a while back with a friend for drinks and dinner. The food is good, but not great. We ordered the sashimi salad, a sashimi special for the day, and buta kim with plenty of plum wine and lychee sake. The sashimi salad was fresh, but the salad was completely drenched in dressing that it kind of killed it for me (I should have asked for dressing on the side). The presentation of the sashimi plate was nice, but I didn't like the taste of the fish (I forgot the name, but it reminded me of saba). My favorite was probably buta kim- the kimchi, meat, and egg turned out to be a good combo.

The service was great, our waitress was very friendly. The restaurant is small, intimate, and very warm. The weather was extremely hot when we came for dinner and there was no ac, kind of a downer. In my opinion, I think this place is a slightly over-priced for its food and decor/environment. Nevertheless its a restaurant worth a try when you are in the area.",3.0
2014,"Went here on a date and it was definitely a winner. The food was delicious and our waitress was full of information on both the food and the sake. One of the best parts was the Sake samplers and being able to learn about the different types to go with all the tapas.

2015,"We had the unfortunate pick of the SPECIAL OF THE DAY. Since being a special obviously no price listed on the menu. The issue that developed was that the data was not  offered by the server when describing the special, especially considering following conclusion of the story. Hind site I should have asked except I did not grow up in a forest. The dish was a 15 piece sashimi assortment. Socking surprise when we got the bill for the ONE DISH, $48 before tax and tip for 15 tiny pieces of fish and scallops, 3 of each.

Again, the server did not warn us of the outrageous price specially when compared to an expected price range based on other similar items on the menu like an order of their 8 piece albacore tataki (one of our other orders) which was $12 and a more labor intensive dish. After asking about the steep premium (unfortunately already paid) they came up with the story of ""expensive components"". Yes, to be truthful there was 3 tiny pieces of tuna belly but the rest of the slices were salmon, tuna, scallops and mackerel. 3 tiny pieces each, all ordinary fish.

We will never go back as I feel stupid and disturbed when trapped, CHEATED, suckered in.... :((((( .... on my Bday !!!!!",1.0
2013,"Went up to berkeley for a food adventure and Kiraku was one of the stops. The place filled up within 30 minutes of opening up.  We were able to get the last table, but not before the waitress told us we only get an hour and a half to finish up because there's a big group coming. So feeling rushed didn't really make us feel welcomed. Lets get on to the food/beverages.

Asahi - on tap - the boys loved it.

Takowasabi - served in a VERY TINY bowl, but had a refreshing taste. Not overly slimy tasting

Corn Tempura - the best of the night!

Beef tongue with truffle oil - good but not worth the $18 dollar price tag.

Buta-Kim - not all that it's hyped up to be. there were like only 3-4 pieces of pork cooked to the point where it's dry and a whole lot of warm kim chi topped with an egg. I was not impressed.  Plus, I've had better kimchi.

Grilled squid - very tender and easy to eat without being slimy as well. I would add a better sauce since asian mayonnaise doesn't cut it for me.

Fried cartilage - Good, but needed a dipping sauce.  Battered and fried with lemon squeezed on it did not give it enough flavor.

Not a great enough izakaya experience/food for me to trek it out here again.",3.0

Fried Garlic
Corn Tempura w/ Green Tea Salt
Nasu Miso (Eggplant)
Chilean Sea Bass Yuzu Ceviche
Roasted Duck and Foie Gras

-The sake sampler: Very cool idea! For $12 we got to sample 3 different types of sake and the waiter was able to explain each type. It's amazin how different sake's can taste. I loved this!

-The corn tempura w/ green sea salt: Um, YUM!!! This was so delicious. They are crunchy, sweet, salty pieces of heaven. A must try!

-The duck potstickers: Good, but nothing to rave about. They literally tasted like any pot sticker I've had in the past.

-Bone marrow w/ roasted garlic: Very delicious buttery bone marrow that melts in your mouth, the garlic is a nice touch too.

-Pork Belly skewers: Delicious! They miso sauce on the side is a great addition to the dish

-Beef Tounge w/ truffle oil & sea salt: This was the highlight of our dinner!!! The beef tounge was sooo tender and the truffle oil just enhanced every bite. If you come here, TRY THIS!!

It felt as if we weren't in on the secret. I saw plenty of people (perhaps more familiar with this style of food?) end up with delicious- and substantial-looking dishes, but everything we ordered was puny, skimpy and hard to eat.

Everything I've tried here so far is excellent and I am now convinced there is not a single bad dish here. One person can usually be full with 2-4 small plates which will run you about $15-$30. My favorites include the corn tempura and sashimi salad--both are unique and delicious! They also have larger dishes that can easily be a full meal by itself. I recommend the rock shrimp ten-don for $10--very flavorful and the shrimp is cooked to perfection with just the right balance of tenderness and crunchiness. They have a very good variety of dishes and everything is reasonably priced. Your meal can be as cheap or expensive as you want depending on what you order, but I can guarantee that it will all taste great!

Servers are professional, helpful and friendly. It can be a bit slow on their busier nights, but it won't ruin your experience.

Pickled tanaka
Octopus with wasabi
Grilled beef tongue
Pork belly skewers
Duck that was served rare like I love
Corn fritters with green tea salt
Eggplant with sweet miso
Spinach with bonito

The agedashi tofu was a bit gloppy rather than the fried pillows of tofu that I love, but one disappointment out of many dishes is minor.

Side note: Usually it costs an arm and a leg for me to get full eating izakaya but their portions end up being surprisingly filling. Definitely a fun date place if you want variety and good food.",5.0
2015,"This restaurant was amaaaaazingggggf! Food, presentation, and service was all top notch. Perfect place for a date if you don't mind sitting close to other people lol. The noise level can get pretty loud but I didn't mind. They have a good variety of sake, wine, and beer. The duck and beef tongue was so good that we got two orders. Like everyone else said, the corn was amazing! We also ordered the toro, bone marrow, mini kaisen donburi, and a pork belly skewer. I personally didn't like the bone marrow but boyfriend loved it. I would make reservations if you can because the wait can get pretty long after 6:30.",5.0
2013,"Ohhh, Kiraku is so good!! Best to go with at least a few friends so you can try all the different dishes. I found out that you can make a reservation ahead of time if folks in your party are planning to order drinks and each person can pay at least $30 for the meal. For the 5 of us on a super busy Friday night, it was well worth it because we bypassed the crowd of people waiting outside and ate and drank A TON.

We ordered from both the regular menu and the specials, and the staffperson was eager to share some helpful recommendations. Highlights included grilled mackerel, nasu miso (eggplant with miso), grilled whole squid, sake sashimi, deluxe chazuke (rice in broth with toppings), and other dishes from the specials page that were all delicious.

As for drinks, two of us ordered sake flights, which is a great way to sample 3 different types and hone in on a favorite that you can keep ordering in the future. The glasses were expertly poured by the waitstaff, and he checked in on us afterwards to see which ones we preferred.

For dessert, we tried the roasted tea blanc-manger, a house special, which I loved for its creamy texture and complicated flavor. Would definitely order again and have one all to myself.

Kiraku, you've become a favorite when I'm in the hood!",4.0
2013,"Very good Japanese tapas: sake, all sorts of small plates- smoked daikon /taro pickles...home made tofu, octopus Wakame pickles...pork belly on a stick. I tried the Fuji apple sake...their limited but high quality sake/sochu, etc was good. I am very happy with the very high quality tapas and the price. Best in the area.

2015,"Really great food in a fun environment. As other reviewers have mentioned, the corn tempura is fabulous and there are plenty of other interesting dishes on the menu, especially if you like delicious little pickled things.

2015,"Preface: 1. If you plan to arrive later than 5 PM (they open at 5:30), you may have to wait. We got there at 5:35, and there was a line formed. On a Friday night, here were 6 parties ahead of us, while all tables were already occupied. It is a small place (12 to 15 tables approximately) and we had to wait approximately 1 hour.

2. It can get pricey, especially, if you like Sake with the Japanese tapas. I do not usually drink Sake but it is almost a must when eating here. The tapas just taste much better with it.

3. I wouldn't recommend it for kids who have yet to develop appreciation for other cultural cuisine. You must take your time to enjoy each bite.

Okay... here is the actual review. GO! If you have disposable income and you like tapas, GO!!! You are still reading this? GO already!

For two people, we tried: Croquette, Roast Duck, Beef Tongue Premium, Black Pork, Uni/Salmon Roe and one of the mini dishes. 2 orders (different Sake), tea and a Sprite. Bill came to $100 - almost exactly. There were other stuff I wanted to try but got full. I could tell you about each dish but most reviews have already covered that. But I just want to reiterate to take your time with each bite, drink Sake and ""listen"" to your taste buds to appreciate and awaken your senses.

On this Friday night, there were 4 waitresses and they all seem attentive. I don't think they are assigned any particular table(s) - as a result, it is one of the most attentive wait staff that I have ever had. They were patient; they explain things well; and suggest good things if you need a clue.

Allow yourself to wait if arriving late. Don't let it ruin your evening, like it did to a few reviewers. If there are empty tables, they are allowing time for the people who reserved, to arrive but they only give them a few minutes before they lose their table.",4.0

However, once seated among the sights and scents this establishment has to offer all is forgiven. Those pesky drawbacks almost seem quaint after plates are delivered and your tastebuds sample the cuisine. My colleague and I sampled numerous dishes, a list too long to remember let alone enumerate here. Suffice it to say, there are plenty of options to love.",5.0
2013,"Kiraku is certainly the real deal, which is surprising given how few truly Japan quality restaurants there are here in Northern California.  I don't mean to crap on local sushi places or those travesties they call ramen shops here.  Well, actually I do.  But the bottom line is that the vast majority of places just don't compare with a decent place in Tokyo.

Which is why Kiraku was such a pleasant discovery this last summer.  Real nama Asahi on draft (the only Japanese beer that's actually brewed in Japan and not Canada).  Good high quality home made tofu.  Sashimi that's selected carefully.  Authentic menu that's strong all around.  Good nankotsu, kushimono, yakimono.  Oyako donburi, buta kimuchi.

It's been a whiles since I've hit my favorite izakaya in Tokyo, so I won't really draw direct comparisons here.  Will say Kiraku reminds me quite favorably with the better izakaya in New York, such as Sakagura or, well, maybe just Sakagura since even NYC lacks truly authentic izakaya.  Compared to NYC perhaps lacks in sake variety, though has a good sochu menu.

Anyhow, highly recommended.  Prices are startlingly reasonable.  Lines, well, they are what they are.",4.0
2012,"What a cute little restaurant! Great atmosphere because of the Japanese art and design. Because of the small size, you might have to wait some time to get a table. Everything here comes in small portions and so don't expect to become full if you're not willing to shell up more than $15 per person.

Renkon (taro chips) [++]  - super oily but absolutely delectable.
Aged Tofu [+] - very small portions (4 cubes) , but has a nice sweet sauce
Seared duck [+++] - the BEST thing here. Even though it's quite expensive, you have to try it if you're a fan of meat.
Corn Tempura [+] - decent item. Good for vegetarians, but nothing impressive.
Chicken Karaage [+] - big chunks of fried chicken with sweet mayo which you can dip with everything else.
Ebi Mayo [+] - similar to honey walnut shrimp.
Buta Kim [++] - reallllly tasty pork with kimchi. Barely had any pork, but it was the warmest item on our table. Would have been amazing with some rice.",4.0
2012,"I'm being perhaps a bit too quick to rate Kiraku 5 stars, but it's been indispensable in satiating my Japanese cravings. Where I come from, izakayas are a staple. So you can imagine how happy I was that one was opening up on my street, just a couple blocks from my apartment!

Kiraku is tiny, but it makes up for its size with a diverse menu and friendly service. Reserve in advance, unless you like waiting outside in the cold. I've been to Kiraku about 6~7 times, and I've probably had around 50-60% of the menu. I've never had anything I really didn't like, and my favorites are the sea bass ceviche and the beef tongue. The fried garlic is also a great snack to munch on. I liked it so much that I made it at home the other day! They don't have buta kakuni, which makes me sad, but I guess I can make that at home too. I didn't enjoy the roasted duck and the buta-kim as much as I thought I would, but most people would probably find them delicious.

I always eat as much as I want here, and the bill for 2 usually amounts to 50-70$ (and that's with me stuffing my face). Their grapefruit yogurt sorbet is absolutely divine, so make sure you try that on your way out.

I've been to many izakayas, and I'm happy to say that Kiraku is a formidable competitor to the best of the best. !",5.0

2014,"I don't even know where to start. I've been eating around Berkeley and the Bay Area for awhile now but realized I'd not gone to Kiraku which was walking distance from my school. Went for a Thursday night dinner with my lady to end a long week (for me at least). Took awhile for us to be seated (note: reservations can be made during the day time but it may take a few calls to get through. They won't take reservations after the start time of 5:30) but they were also really courteous and apologetic about it. Got seated.

Order: (One of the warm sakes, it was a colder night), the roasted angus beef tongue, the sashimi special, corn tempura, grilled rice ball, and the suzuki (? I think) carpaccio.

Pros: The sashimi selection changes (daily? I'm not sure) but when I went it tasted like Jesus, I'm sorry for the blasphemy but it was actually outrageously good. Yes, to all the sashimi aficionados, there is better sashimi out there in the world but at least in the Bay Area, what I tasted tonight was one of my better sashimi experiences. First time having beef tongue but ugh, I'm pretty sure I'll be devastatingly disappointed the next time I eat beef tongue somewhere else. Simple minimalist prep and presentation but oh my is it good. The flavor from the roasting process (I assume) gave it the smokiness that you expect from a roast or grill without the burning taste of coal. It wasn't tender per se, kind of a cross between a really soft piece of meat that also has some bite to it (I think that's just how tongue is), conclusion, bloody good. The carpaccio was great too, not much to say but it was just really well seasoned and marinated. The grilled riceball, I mean come on, it's a grilled rice ball, but it helped fill me up and complemented everything else on the table which was great. The corn tempura, I don't know, I'm not that big of a fan of corn and tempura's never really impressed me but this was just really pleasant to eat, that's about it really, it was really good. It was crispy, un-oily, not over-battered, it was pleasant. All in all, flavor gets a full score.

Cons: The sashimi special does not come with a price tag. They do ask you what you which fish(es) you would like served but we just got three pieces of each. Maybe the price varies depending on what you got but ours came out to be $60 for the sashimi. I may have been upset at the blindsiding but the fish was so good I really was just like, ""take my money"". That being said, if you came simply going, ""oh look, $$ price range"", maybe you shouldn't get the sashimi. If you drop money like it's hot though, get it, get two plates of it, I don't know, it's heavenly. (mmmm borderline blasphemy)

Final thoughts: It was amazing, probably best restaurant period in the downtown Berkeley/ southside area. Will definitely go again but probably not on a weekly basis, wonderful place to treat yourself or someone else out to though :)",5.0
2012,"My only complaint was that I went with only one other person.  So each plate comes with probably 4 large pieces to share and between the two of us it got tiring to eat the same thing.   The plates also came out one at a time, so we'd sit there eating just chicken for a good 10 mins,  then eating just tempura corn, then just fish.  It just got very overwhelming very fast.

2015,"How have I not written a review about Kiraku yet??! My first time here was about 4 years ago with my sister and one of our friends, and we were so stuffed, satisfied, and in Japanese tapas-heaven that I've gone back multiple times since then. Waitstaff is always courteous and attentive. I've always gone when the restaurant opens, around 5pm, because there usually isn't a wait at this time.

WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN:
1) corn tempura: everyone's favorite. just get it and try and it and you'll understand!
2) grilled beef tongue: I've always been a fan of beef tongue--for those of you who love this, tongue is super tender and melts in your mouth!
3) osaka style taro potato: mm so soft and a good combination of sweet from the taro and the savory from the okonomiyaki sauce
4) rock shrimp tempura: this was surprisingly pretty tasty, but I think I'd only get this dish again when I feel like it.
5) karaage: who doesn't like fried chicken?
6) clams w/ butter: good, but not great. I didn't feel like this had enough flavor...I would try it again though
7) buta-kim: a poached egg in a hot sizzling plate of pork belly and kim chi...mmmm!
8) roasted duck kiraku style: honestly this looks SO good in pictures, but when we had it I wasn't wow'd by it, and neither were anyone else who tried it. boo...I felt like it was kind of bland.
9) pork belly: good, but not great for the price.

Started with superb black snapper sashimi, the daily special, but they ran out of it very quickly and we couldn't get seconds. Grilled mackerel was overcooked and oversalted, beef/potato dumplings (""Butcher balls"") were too potatoey; the grilled stuff in general tasted almost like they were grilled over gas, there was none of that wood flavor you get from say Ippuku.

2014,"Awesome spot for pairing sake with a bunch of tasty small plates.  The restaurant has limited space so it's likely to come across a wait list.  I went on a Friday night around 8pm and waited 30 minutes for a 4 top.  However, the dining experience is definitely worth the wait.  This place is nestled between a smoke shop and weed dispensary so there's actually some interesting window shopping nearby to kill time.

The wait staff was super friendly and accommodating.  

A few recommendations:

Sake:  Crystal Dragon.  Ginjo Kokuryu ""Tokusen"" - light and pairs well with everything. It's light but it can get you buzzin.

Starter: Tsumami Sampler (pick 3 off the list): Pickles were amazingly smokey. Octopus in wasabi, and seared spicy cod row.  Each item had a unique and bold flavor.  These were all great with sake.

Main:  Beef tongue with truffle oil.  If you're not into tongue, then steer clear.  If you're down for tongue, this is all you.

We also tried the daily special sashimi platter which was excellent.  The fish quality was top notch.

Totally treat yourself to a tsunami sampler with the baby squid, iidako, and spicy jellyfish. I thought it was a little rude that the waiter warned me against the baby squid due to it's strong taste, but how would she know I grew up on Japanese food?

The chicken karaage and corn tempura are must haves! The chicken karaage takes a while to come out, but it's soooo worth. Juicy, fried chicken with lemony mayonnaise! And if you love corn, the corn tempura will seem like it came out of your dream.

If you're feeling adventurous and are considering the fried cartilage, don't do it. Yes, you expect bones, but it gets really tiresome crunching that much. And there is very little taste to it. Try the fried ginko nuts instead if they're available!

Some of my favorite dishes so far are:
1) Corn Tempura w/ Green Tea Sea Salt - lightly salted fried corn patties, sooo good!
2) Organic Chicken Karaage - I've gotten this every time I've come it. It's one of those can't fail dishes. Moist and flavorful!
3) Ramen - It's pretty basic ramen, but I love the clean taste of the broth!
4) Roasted Duck and Foie Gras - I'M IN LOVE. I had this on my most recent visit here and I'm seriously craving it again. (The daikon was good too, but I love duck more)
5) Agedashi Tofu - I have a friend who is obsessed with this. I can see why, it's delicious! I love to get this at sushi restaurants, but the Agedashi tofu here seems more mature and complex.
6) ButaKim - Pork, Egg, and Kimchi! This is pretty bomb!
7) Homemade Grapefruit Ice Cream - Soooo refreshing!

I've tried alot of other things, but those are probably my favorite so far.

I love the service here, they're always really nice and helpful. I also had a huge party here before (for my birthday) and they were really patient with us!  I especially like how they give you a hot towel on arrival to clean your hands too! They are kind of weird about the bill, so if you come in a group, try to bring cash because they only like to charge 1 card.",5.0
2013,"This is by far my favorite izakaya place out of the ones I've been to in the Bay Area. The plates I have ordered were unique in their presentation and flavors! Out of their more popular dishes (lotus root chips, kimchi pork, corn tempura, chicken karaage, etc.), I'd rank them as follows:

1. Corn Tempura: This plate never gets old. Every time I've been to Kiraku, this dish is always on our order. The portions they give you are satisfying, and it's salted perfectly. The texture is not too crispy (although one time our order was a little too fried, but maybe just to me because I'm not a fan of crispier deep fried goods), and the batter-to-corn ratio is perfect! Wonderful for all people who love corn. Guilty as charged over here.

2. Chicken Karaage: Other yelpers describe it well -- the chicken is fried perfectly, leaving the outside crispy while the meat is tender and moist. If only I could get my fried chicken to taste like that. Unfortunately, it's far from it. The creamy sauce that goes with it (a Japanese mayo and slight lemon taste to it) complements it well, though I personally prefer it without. The taste of the chicken alone is savory enough!

3. Bone Marrow: I'm not too crazy about bone marrow, but Kiraku serves it good enough. The marrow is flavorful, though admittedly the buttery taste was a bit overwhelming for me.

4. Kimchi Pork: This dish was just...good. I love pork belly, and I think the dish does a good job of preserving the pork's natural fatty flavors. There is more kimchi than I would like, but the egg tops off this dish and makes all the flavors combine very well.

5. Lotus Root Chips: I love fried lotus root, but out of the two times I've ordered this, the chips were too crispy -- losing a lot of its flavor and lotus root quality. It tastes more like overly fried, bland potato chips for me. I want to give it another chance, but all of their other dishes are so amazing and worth trying that I may not consider this one unless I absolutely can't find anything else to order on the menu! That, however, is highly unlikely given that they have quite an extensive menu.

Other things I've tried that are worth mentioning/must-tries: Their chicken udon and pesto udon, jaga-butter potatoes (on their special menu), ika squid plate. The udons are absolutely perfect. Seriously. Jaga-butter potatoes consisted of these small halved baked potatoes on Popsicle skewers, drizzled on top with a buttery, mayo-y sauce made with cod roe. SO. GOOD. Too bad they don't usually have this. Otherwise I guarantee I would order it every single time. The squid plate is a whole squid cut in slices, pan-fried and glazed perfectly with a sweet but savory teriyaki-like sauce...

Lets just say, there are a lot of items on the menu to discover and enjoy. This place is definitely worth a visit. And another visit, and another... And then, yeah, another. NEVER SHALL IT STOP.

This was the 5 course meal that my best friend and I at Berkeley generated for ourselves before the start of finals week. Given that I had three finals the next day, I felt like that I deserved this.
Everything about the meal was perfect, I had the ramen while my friend had udon. The soup for the ramen was a bit salty, but the soup for the udon was spot on. We started off for Buta Kim and Corn Tempura as appetizers: the Buta Kim was amazing, the Kim Chi and egg were perfect together. The Corn Tempura was great, but not amazing.
The highlight of the meal was probably the roasted tea blanc-manger, which was unique and perfect in every way. I would highly recommend this if you have room for it.

2011,"I've grown tired of Japanese places that try too hard to appeal to Western palettes and egos. The result too often is that sushi becomes too saucy, and izakaya and yakitori fare becomes too expensive because it's new and chic, (and namely not sushi).

Kiraku firmly makes a stand that Japanese food can be a diverse culinary experience, affordable and confidently simple all at the same time. Kiraku is Izakaya pub food that isn't trying too hard. Japanese comfort food is at it's foundation quite simple. Kiraku takes this idea and subtly tweaks classic components of both Japanese and Western cuisine to produce delicious experiences.

We loved the miso glazed eggplant, Popeye salad with spinach, assorted mushrooms, and bacon; and the foie gras daikon was superb. Also try the yuzu udon for a new citrus twist to this classic soup.

On top of a diverse menu they have an excellent selection of shouchu, sake, awamori, beer, and wine.

2013,"We arrived shortly after they opened for Dinner service (5:00) and had to wait for a four-top to clear, which took about 20 minutes.  It was the perfect time to check what people were ordering and look at all the beautiful food coming out of the kitchen.

After we were seated I informed our server that it was our first time there and she patiently went over the menus (standard and specials), highlighting the popular dishes.  We ordered Orion beer, and about 5 dishes (corn tempura, ika, sake pickles, duck potstickers, and ceviche).  The pickles were like Umami bombs; good but took a while for the palette to reach equilibrium.  They were addictive once you got over the initial shock.  The corn tempura was like State Fair food, and although good, not something I would order again.  The squid was pretty fresh and came with a nice mayo dipping sauce, but the pigment was left on the skin and added to the chewiness.

After round 1, we ordered a couple of yakitori pieces (beef tongue and pork belly).  Both had great grill flavor.  The beef was rich and textured with layers of meat and fat.  We topped off by splitting the raspberry sorbet, which had a brulee topping on it, which was burnt.  The effect was to look like cubes of glazed pork, which was striking and slightly odd since it also came with a dollop of creme fraiche.  After a couple of pieces, I removed the burned sugar and it was much better solo.

Service was very attentive, and the bathrooms were clean.  The place was very cozy (seating for about 20) but exactly what you expect from an Izakaya type restaurant.  Small flub on the brulee kept me from giving it a 5, but I would love to go back the next time I'm in the Bay Area.",4.0
2015,OH.MY.GOD!! It's really that good and the service was impeccable. Food was spot on - all of it!!! The place is small but it adds to the charm of this little izakaya. Wait could take a little longer but definitely worth it. I will definitely keep coming to this place!,5.0
2016,"Hands down my favorite place to visit in all of Berkeley, maybe even the entire Bay Area. Ingredients are fresh, dishes well thought out and service is impeccable.  Current favs include: fried corn tempura, osaka style taro potato, sashimi salad and the deluxe chazuke.  Definitely try the sake flights!",5.0
2014,"Went with two friends and we each ordered about 3 things. They do tapas style plates, so most dishes were small.  The grilled octopus was a large portion.  The maitake tempura was probably my favorite.  The Rock shrimp, over rice with egg was also flavorful and sweet. More of a meal, and shrimp was done perfectly. The pork belly skewer was good, but not amazing like the sauce with it!  Mackerel was nice and oily.  Rice balls were tasty and filling.  Croquettes were good.  Sake pickles were unusual, wouldn't order again. Friends ordered some drinks too.  It came to $100, which seems a bit pricey, but Im a bargain hunter, so maybe it's typical for food with drinks at a Japanese restaurant?!  Small cozy atmosphere, and a bit of a wait.  Jazz music was a nice background addition.  Two spots to sit inside while waiting for a table, awkward when there are more than 2 people waiting!",3.0
2012,"I am SOOOO confused as to why this place has such a good rating.

So I have tried quite a few izakaya places and I usually enjoy myself. My friends and I are all for trying new places and I rely on Yelp a lot to decide on what to try. Which is why I was so thoroughly disappointed when I came to Kiraku.

So here's the story. I came to Kiraku on Wednesday night with a bunch of friends. We came here after KBBQ and we're just going to come in for drinks and snacks. I didn't read the Yelp reviews first so I didn't realize there was a $12 minimum per person so that was our fault. And since there was 6 of us, they pretty much made a good $72 off us easy. So after we sat down, my friends and I went on to read the tips from Yelp on my iPhone and ordered our food. and that was when the disappointment began.

it was quite busy for a wednesday night, I will give them that. But our drinks took almost 20 minutes (really, how hard can that be to give me a can of coke and a cup of ice? I was DD for the night so I didn't order any alcohol). Then we waited almost an HOUR just to START getting our food.

We got the Corn tempura with green tea salt first which just perplexes me because we also ordered the buttered corn and that took a good 30 minutes to come out after the corn tempura. The corn tempura that everyone was raving about is basically just deep-fried corn doused with salt. The buttered corn was just canned corn thrown onto a cast-iron skillet, no butter included.

We also ordered the Roasted tea Blanc Manger which may very well be the ONLY redeeming thing about this place. It was light and fluffy and definitely tasted pretty good. We ordered a few other items but nothing was actually worth mentioning.

The last two items that came were the dessert obviously. But why it  came out almost an hour after the Roasted Tea Blanc was just confusing considering that was also a dessert. We ordered the Sweet Potato Brulee and the Green Tea Ice cream with Warabi Mochi. It took a good 20 minutes AFTER we were completely done with our food and drinks. It would have made sense if they didn't notice we were done but they had already cleared all our empty dishes from the table.

What I'm trying to say is that the service the WHOLE night was just plain disappointing. Drinks took way too long. Food took even longer (and for canned corn thrown onto a cast-iron skillet...REALLY?!). Everyone else seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves here on Yelp so maybe we just happened to come at a really bad night. But all in all, I wasted a good 2 hours of my life sitting around waiting on nothing.

Pretty sure I'll never come here again. There are better Izakaya places and with better service",1.0

Carpaccio : the first and best dish we. ordered. Fresh, well balanced and seasoned well.
Sashimi: fresh,nice presentation. Sliced a bit too thin.
Beef tongue: perfectly cooked good flavors overall, sliced a bit too thick.
Donburi: not a fan of salmon roe, dish was crammed into a tiny bowl made it difficult to eat but nice presentation. Uni was fantastic, rice could be seasoned more with a touch of vinegar. Would not order again.
Maitake mushroom tempura: interesting flakes of ""sancho"" herbs at the bottom of plate that makes your tongue tingle.  The rest lacks flavor and was too oily. Not sure of oil was oxidized. What you would expect from tempura I guess.
Service: fantastic, fast, helpful staff.

2013,"Came here last night with some old friends, so we had a gang of eight. Pretty much ate everything on the specials menu! It was all great! Some of our highlights were the sashimi, grilled black pork belly, Kobe beef skewers, roasted beef tongue, agadashi tofu, spicy french fries, pork cutlet, hamachi Kama, chicken karaage and homemade duck potstickers. But the fav of my gang was the grilled beef marrow w/ crunchy garlic sauce. We also tried the udon and ramen. Lets just say we had a hungry bunch. Desserts were yummy too. Think we decided the grapefruit frozen yogurt was the BOMB!

One thing to note. We had four kids ( ages 10-13 ) with our party of eight. Since we weren't a big party of drinkers, we couldn't make a reservation. We ended up coming in at 5:30pm, opening time. Able to get a table for all of us, but were requested to be done by 7pm. Since they had a reservation of eight coming in. I'm thinking some folks might get bent out of shape because of this, but I don't think it's a big deal. Izakaya is pub food, meaning alcohol is really part of the picture here. I'm just happy to be able to bring the kids into a place that serves great food.

This is a tiny Japanese restaurant that delivers delicate Japanese dishes other than sushi and sashimi. My girlfriend and I instantly fell in love with their food when we went there the very first time. However, more and more dinners have been attracted to this place ,so an approximate wait time can be easily stretched to over 2 hours on any weekdays especially when there are reservations. The worst part is the wait because the restaurant is too tiny to have a waiting area inside, so dinners will have to standby on streets. They don't open everyday, and they only open at nights. It's highly suggested to make a reservation if you plan to eat at this place.",4.0

Food (4.5/5)

My must-gets every time: chicken karaage, sashimi, and saba shio.

- Chicken Karaage (5/5) - My favorite dish here. Perfectly juicy, always comes out super hot, perfect garlic level, absolutely no complaints at all. Imo much better than Ippuku's
- Sashimi (5/5) - Get whatever fresh fish of the day they have on their specials menu. Always very fresh. Salmon, yellowtail, mackerel, etcs
- Salmon carpaccio (5/5) - Delicious! Very pretty too.
- Saba shio (5/5) - Extremely well grilled and fatty.
- Hamachi kama salt (4/5) - Second to their saba shio for grilled fish here. Tastes great still, but they cut the size of the collar in half and increased the price so not as worth it anymore :(
- Clam miso soup (4/5) - Very good, very clammy though so if you like clams..! not on their menu but you can always ask for it
- Beef tongue (4/5) - Very good
- Rock shrimpy tempera (3.5/5) - Very good but the taste is heavy/gets old kind of quickly
- Kiraku rib (3/5) - A little too sweet, not as much meat on the rib as I would have liked
- Agedashi tofu (3/5) - Good, the usual
- Pork belly skewer (3/5) - Good, but the one at Ippuku is much much better
- Crab croquette (3/5) - Decent, not nearly as flavorable as Ippuku's
- Bone marrow (3/5) - Pretty tasty but also a little overly greasy. There wasn't very much marrow on the bone, maybe got a total of half a spoonful.
- Ramen (2/5) - Decent but nothing special, good for guys if you want to fill yourself up at the end
- Yuzu udon (2/5) - Same as ramen

Ambience (4.5/5)

I love the environment here. Great alcohol selection. It does get kind of noisy inside, but it's good for small tables. Also like the decor.

I felt like everything was authentic bc of the story of the restaurant and the servers and staff were actually Japanese. Overall a very good restaurant.

2012,"Came to this place with 4 other people when it first opened.

This is the more authentic type of Japanese cuisine.  Contrary to popular belief, Japanese food is more than just sushi, contrary to my own former ignorance at least...

We couldn't figure out a correct way to order this to feed everyone so just chose randomly.  The portions are all pretty small and since we came at dinner time, we expected something that was more dinner-y in the more traditional sense instead of smaller and more delicate dishes.  

We ordered the stewed oxtail, kiraku rib, spicy jellyfish and balsamico pork.  I personally really like the oxtail because the flavor was on the lighter side.  The oxtail was very tender and the taste was perfectly complemented with herbs.  The soup was clear and savory.  

The other items were alright.  Spicy jellyfish was supposed to be a small dish to go with sake but... we didn't know that.  

I liked one of the meat plates, but forgot if it was the kiraku rib or pork.  But I have this thing for fatty meat, but only if it's cooked a certain way, and kiraku totally did it.  However, fatty meat really stops at one piece.  In fact, no one in my group could finish a whole piece.  

The individual price per dish was acceptable, but the portions are very small.  No one in my group was close to being full after the meal.  But again, we probably just ordered the wrong food.

2012,"came here on a thursday evening around 6pm and was seated right away. the restaurant is kind of small and it gets filled up fast so i would probably recommend making reservations.

the food here is served tapas style. the ones we tried were:

sea bass ceviche - this was a bit weird for me because all the ceviches ive had before were basically raw fish marinated in citrus juice. the sea bass for this dish tasted fully cooked and had an odd creamy texture to it. not something i would get again

jellyfish - a very simple but a delicious lightly spiced appetizer

organic chicken karaage - this is one of my favorites of the night! the chicken is very light and super moist and flavorful

salmon carpaccio - this dish didnt stand out to me at all. it was really bland and lacked some sauce cause it was dry tasting

corn tempura with green tea salt - another favorite of mine. the corn is lightly fried and perfectly salted

roasted duck with foie gras - i LOVE duck and i LOVE foie gras. im trying to eat as much foie gras as i can before it gets banned. i loveee foie gras in its natural form. nice and fatty! the duck was cooked really well but i didn't really like the sweet sauce it came with but without it, it was a bit tasteless

homemade grapefruit ice cream - this was so good! great flavor and very refreshing

sweet potato creme brulee - it was more like super mashed sweet potato topped with the crunchy sugary coat than the creamy custard consistency of a normal creme brulee, but still pretty good

service was a bit slow... but overall it was a really good meal.",4.0

2012,"I absolutely adore izakaya (and Japanese cuisine in general), so I was excited to discover another one open up in Berkeley (the other being Ippuku on Shattuck). I've been here twice, both times leaving me a very happy customer.

The first time was back in... September, I think. A friend and I came in late-ish for the sake samplers. I'm not a huge fan of Asian spirits, but it was interesting tasting the subtle differences between the various types of shochu (I had barley, rice, and brown sugar). They come in this cute platter with cupholders, and our server gracefully answered our questions about the drinks. Munchies came around, and we ended up ordering the Takowasabi (wasabi-marinated octopus) and Jumbo Squid. Both were packed with flavour and satisfied my salty tooth.

I came in again today for a kinda-sorta-Valentine's Day dinner (if ya know what I mean). Here's what we ordered:
Nasu Miso: Eggplant pieces in a gravy/miso sauce. The shell is hard and kind of serves as a bowl, so you have to scoop the flesh out. The savouriness of the sauce compliments the sweetness of the eggplant very well, and the texture is the perfect softness without being mushy or stringy.
Organic Chicken Karaage: Medium-sized pieces of chicken, deep fried to crispy perfection. Meat is tender and juicy, and is served with Japanese dressing.
Soft Shell Shrimp: I've never had shrimp with the shell and head before, so this was something new. Not overwhelmingly salty and had a great crunch. Comes with shredded lettuce salad/garnish.
Grilled Mackerel: Again, I usually don't eat the skin but I couldn't resist - the fish had that fresh chewiness to it, and the skin had a thin layer of fat underneath that was really tasty without tasting like blubber.
Buta-Kim: Slices of pork belly with kimchi. There's also a poached egg in there, which was very well prepared. The pork belly wasn't too fatty, so no complaints here.
Roasted Tea Blanc-Manger: A tea-flavoured pudding with a touch of cream, red bean paste, and mini tapioca. One of the best puddings I've had in a while. Served in an adorable wooden cup.

Every dish was very delicately put together and we had an excellent meal. It came to about $60 (with tip), which I feel is slightly cheaper than Ippuku (but not by much). Service was great and the staff was super friendly - our water was constantly refilled, we were offered tea to go with our dessert, and the chef even snuck his head out to ask how we were liking our meal. CYUTE.

The restaurant isn't very big and can seat maybe 30ish people at a time, but I can assure you it is well worth the wait. Otherwise, make a reservation before coming in. The tables are snug, but everything is very well taken care of and clean. Such a great place for an intimate dinner with that special someone or close friends, I'll definitely be coming back!",5.0

Assorted sashimi:  B
Very fresh, but the portion left alot to be desired given the price.  Three types of fish, so not quite as much variety as a full sushi bar.

Ribs:  A+
The ribs were cooked the perfection and were falling off the bone.  The flavors were very aromatic (soy sauce, staranese, and sesame).  Portions were not great, but definitely better value than the sashimi

Beef tongue:  A+
Great flavor; a bit more gamey than traditional cuts of beef.  Seasoned and braised to perfection.  Incredibly tender,

The service was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious, although a bit pricey for my liking.
The great thing about Izakayas, especially if you're not drinking, is that you get to try a whole bunch of different foods. Try everything! My party ordered around 8 dishes and everything was equally as delicious.

2012,"When I found out that there is a minimum charge per person if you want to make a reservation, I chanced it by ushering our friends to get there by 5:30 when the door opens.  They only have two high chairs and our toddler doesn't know what ""wait"" means, which made getting there early that much more crucial.

Just as I suspected, soon after we started eating the restaurant was completely filled by 6.  And surprisingly plenty of families with small kids so there is definitely competition for high chairs.

It's not a place with a quick turnaround---a characteristic shared by restaurants that serve small plates.  Diners often do  the ""we will start with this and that"" and a few drinks later, your mind tricks you into thinking you need more salt and grease in your belly.  At this point, dinner is no longer a quick one-dish meal, but morphs into a everlasting social feast.

I didn't drink and therefore felt silly indulging in the salt and grease.  Crunchy lotus chips and corn butter would have been perfect to nibble on with alcohol.  Grilled fish like mackerel and black cod are tasty and easy to pick.  Then there were the different types of don and chazuke to sooth your tummy afterwards.

Everything was super tasty and super unhealthy.  And we ended up paying around $35 per person after tips and taxes, pricier than anticipated.  But it was worth the money and clogged arteries.  Whether you intend to enjoy the food sober or drunk, either way you will have a good time.",4.0
2012,"Summary:
Food - 4.5 / 5
Service - 5/5
Wait-time - 4/5

Overall: 4.5/5

Came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night and it was jam packed. Didn't have to wait too long but I think we were really lucky and beat the line. Next time we will definitely be making a reservation first.

The services was exceptional. We received warm towelettes before we ordered. That's just A+ service right there. Waitresses were extremely attentive. But most important of all, they seem to serve food based on a specific order. They made sure to give us our appetitzers one-by-one, right after another, and brought up the main dishes with plates/bowls to share. That to me is extreme attention to details and Zappos like customer service.

Food was really good as well. We ordered:
Shime Saba - excellent, a must try if you are saba sushi fan
Salmon Carpaccio - very good, though the salmon could have been a little more creamier
Chilean Seabass Ceviche - very good, a good amount of seabass mixed with the rest; I'm undecided on the chips that came along with it, they were very crispy and tasty but not sure if they went well together
Tempura Ebi Mayo - very good, satisfied our fried/fatty foods craving
Sangria - very good, I think they mixed it with Plum Wine as well, interesting but good
Ramen - good, tasted very refreshing but not too much to rave about here

Overall, if you are in Berkeley and looking for a cozy place to have a nice meal and conversation. This is the spot to go.",5.0

2012,"Japanese tapas? Whaaaat???

We came here by recommendation of a friend - we were taking some special guests out for dinner and wanted a yummy, special spot. I was a bit apprehensive at first bc generally ""tapas"" = ""spendy, really quick, without you realizing it"".

Lotus Root Chips with Celery Salt - so beautifully presented. a feast for the eyes and really tasty on the tastebuds also.
Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - like normal corn cakes... lightly dusted with green tea powder.
Kiraku Salad - (Mizuna/Arugula/Shungiku/Ham/Red Onion) - very good.
Popeye Salad - (Spinach Salad w/ Sauted Mushrooms and Bacon on top) - very good but not surprising flavor combo.
Grilled whole saba - THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. So soft and tender and juicy. It was a big ol' piece of fish also.
Sashimi - thick and fresh. we ordered another order because it seemed to disappear beneath our chopsticks.
Ramen/Udon - delicious. but we were getting too full and couldn't do this justice.

BUT we still managed to save room for dessert: ROASTED TEA BLANC-MANGER - it was like a light custard / tea-flavored creme brulee. I was so full but couldn't resist cleaning this off.",4.0
2012,"This place is solid.  I'm a stickler when it comes to izakayas and Japanese food, but this is the real deal.

Some favorites were the bone marrow, maru ika (squid), nasu miso, and the corn tempura.  The rock shrimp in the spicy mayo was also really good.  I have a feeling anything here will be really good, and I can't wait til I can go back again.

Service is also really good.  My boyfriend and I love it here, and I can't wait to bring friends.  It does get really busy so come early or make a reservation (which also comes with some conditions).",5.0
2015,"Our server, Yuka, was very friendly and professional! She took the time to explain their specials and describe the sake sampler she gave us to try. It's pretty tiny and gets loud (in a fun way) so not the best place for the hard-of-hearing.",4.0
2012,"Finally, something I love around the campus area.

This place is coming close to B-Dama in my books. Get lots of the appetizer items and less of the rice/noodle dishes. Not that the noodles and rice aren't good, they just don't stand out much compared to the other dishes.

The grilled jump squid is DELISH. Karaage chicken, thumbs up. Corn tempura was not quite as good as I would have thought, but I think everyone got my hopes up too much.

Duck dumplings....couldn't really tell they were duck, but still good. The pesto udon was a nice fusion, for sure. And the yuzu chicken udon's broth was bomb. But the meat itself was a bit tough for my tastes, and I couldn't really taste any yuzu.

Saba shio was yummers too.

Definitely coming back. But, beware of the lines! This place is small and gets packed!

I think they serve Haagen Dazs green tea ice cream with their warabi mochi. And beware, warabi mochi is not really mochi...it's more of a jelly like texture. So, there were some people in our group who were rather disappointed. But, I have no discrimination in my love of mochi or jelly, so it was all good for me.",5.0
2015,How can you not love this place? They had a Foie special that was freaking amazing. Small restaurant though so there will always be a line.

2012,"I recommend this place for Japanese Tapa cuisine.

This place gave me a lot of exciting/fun/interesting food experience.
- Fried Lotus root!: must order this for appetizer! It is like chips but fresh fried.
- Kimchi with pork belly: The pork belly is tender and with a sunny side up egg on the top of it. Perfect combination. My only complain would be too much kimchi, and too little meat.
- Roasted duck: This cuisine is just awesome. I prefer the meat medium rare, the texture of the meat is tender and tasty.

Last but not the least,
- order a hot sake with the dishes that you order. It will be the highlight of your meal :)",4.0
2012,"A little pricey, but totally worth it for the quality. Coming back from Spain, I pretty much miss the tapas style kind of restaurants. Luckily there are a lot of izakayas locations near me that I did not know about! I love trying food in small portions because I can fit much more different dishes in my stomach!

I came here with a few people and we ordered probably close to 10 dishes... we ordered the fried garlic, the karaage, salmon sashimi, buta-kim, foi gras daikon, white asparagus, calamari, eggplant, some ribs, and of course.. BEER!

My ultimate favorite .. maybe favorite 2 were the ribs and the salmon sashimi.... third runner up has to be the foi gras daikon (surprisingly!) The ribs were SOOOO good, literally it melted in my mouth and exploded with flavor! The sashimi was VERY soft and also melted in my mouth. Just like butta.

This place is very small, so come early or you will be waiting for a while. The servers are very welcoming as well. One thing I really enjoyed was their timing in bringing out dishes. The dishes never overcrowded our small table and they kept on coming! Our appetizer (the karaage) came out LAST and was also bigger than the average bite size.

Totally worth it to come if you're looking for high-quality, authentic Japanese!",4.0

2011,"Kiraku is so new I wasn't able to check-in to it when we ate here last night!

We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was still pretty full.  

They don't have a huge wine list but they have Asahi beer on draft from Japan.

The MUST orders:

Garlic Tempura.  OMG. Best invention EVER.  This is the only reason I'd drive across the bay to eat here again.

Corn Fritters.  Done well.  As good as E&O Trading company.

The ""it's ok"" orders:

Kim Chi and Pork Belly with egg in a skillet.  Hubby liked this.  I'm not a Kim Chi fan, so it was a miss for me.  

Seared Foie Gras with Roasted Duck in some sauce.  This was a miss for me.  The roasted duck was tough to chew through.  I had to ask for a fork and knife.  The foie gras was ok, but way too rich to just eat alone.  It needed some kind of bread or something to smear it on.  I used the corn fritters or the fried garlic...but felt like my heart was going to stop beating on the spot from the high fat content.  Also, the presentation was weird.  The foie gras was hidden under the duck.  Shouldn't Foie Gras be the center piece?  

Hubby also got the trio sampler of some WEIRD stuff.  The waitress even asked him twice if he's sure he wanted to try it.  

Total for the bill along with 2 beers and a glass of wine was $96.  Not too bad, but I wouldn't drive that far for it and I wouldn't really go there again if i was in the area.",3.0

2014,"This place is not for a college student on a budget. I repeat, if you are counting the pennies you find under your couch pillow, this place is not for you.

However, if you are willing to drop some serious bucks for a really fun and delicious Japanese tapas meal, this place is for you. I just wanted to put that warning out there because this place is pretty pricey and I don't think that most college students understand that tapas mean they will be coming out in small appetizer like portions. But what they lack in quantity they make up for in quality. I came here with my boyfriend and was well aware that this would be a pricey dinner. I think that's key when coming here because if you're stuck on how expensive everything is, you won't get to enjoy the tapas style where you get a taste of everything. Just to give a sense of how expensive this place is, I spent over $100 with just my boyfriend and I, including tip. Now, we both did have some sake so that did up the tab quite a bit but it was fun, their presentation is cute and I liked trying some sake over the usual beer.

Onto the food, we had:
- mini pork belly skewers
- fried stingray fin
- kaisen donburi
- wagyu beef
- albacore yuzu ceviche

Looking back at the menu, none of these items are still listed except for the albacore ceviche. I now for sure the wagyu beef and donburi came off a special menu so I don't know if you can get it again. Hands down, the ceviche was my favorite dish out of all of them. I would go back and wait the hour again just so I could gorge myself on the ceviche. I also really love albacore though but the flavors were so perfect with the cilantro and the lime, it was perfect. Also the fish was phenomenal, and this is coming from a girl who's spent about 8 years working at a sushi restaurant. Their fish in general is just amazing, the donburi, while incredibly small was incredibly fresh tasting and I wanted to order another. My boyfriend's favorite was the wagyu beef, I think it's some special kind of Japanese beef, very unique savory flavor. He's really big on his beef too and his reaction was just priceless, made the whole trip worth it. Everything else was pretty good, it was fun but I don't know if I'd order the other items again, I'd probably want to try something new from their menu.

Also, I would definitely pick this place over Kirala at any time. Wait time is comparable but you can actually make reservations here. I just like the ambiance, it's a tinier restaurant and while it still has a good buzz going on you can easily hear your dining partners talk. Also the waitstaff is just really friendly and patient! Overall, I look forward to going back and if you don't mind dropping the money, check this place out!",5.0
2013,Still great. And the service is even better than I remember. Attentive and knowledgeable and friendly. I came again with 3 other friends and just started ordering a ton. No misses in my opinion.

Here's what the 3 of us shared:

SEAWEED (salad) - standard
AGEDASHI TOFU - delicious soft tofu swimming in broth
CORN TEMPURA W/ GREEN TEA SALT - nice touch w/the green tea salt, but there was too much batter for my liking
BEEF TONGUE - yes, get this !
JUMBO SQUID (grilled) - excellent!
SPANISH MACKAREL SASHIMI  - excellent!
FRIED RICE (seafood) - It was a little bland compared to the rest of the dishes.

And save some room for dessert!
ROASTED TEA BLANC-MANGE (it reminds me of panna cotta. light and delicious!)
GREEN TEA ICE CREAM w/ Warabi Mochi

I definitely was able to try a few things and I was very satisfied with the quality and taste of everything! The corn tempura was something worth having and I liked the fish cakes.

2012,"We've jumped on the izakaya bandwagon and were excited to venture beyond Ippuku.

Per Yelp's suggestions, we ordered the following:
1. Wasabi octopus - Wow! Super wasabi-bite-in-the-nose flavorful. Tiny portion.
2. Seaweed salad - Same as anywhere.
3. Pickled leaves - Tart and salty, tasty but small portion.
4. Fried chicken - Served with aioli, crispy batter, juicy chicken.
5. Tempura corn - Good, but a little more chewy than i expected. Probably better when corn is in season, since this was obviously defrosted or canned corn in tempura batter.
6. Salmon carpaccio - Salmon sashimi, with sliced tomatoes and onions on top. Great presentation, although the toppings overshadow the flavor of the fish. I'd order this for someone who is comfortable with lox on a bagel but who might not be ready to graduate to real sashimi.
7. Green tea ice cream with mochi - delicious ice cream, not too sweet; mochi made with matcha powder; served with a small side of bean paste that I expected to be red bean but tasted like unsweetened mashed brown lentils. Everything was lovely except the lentils, which were bland and seemed out of place.

The service was friendly; our waitress warned us that the appetizers would be small and strongly flavored, noting that ""this is more of a drink-y place"" and that these plates were designed to complement their sake offerings.

Overall, the food was tasty and varied, although the quality of the dishes was not quite as high as Ippuku (though the prices are comparable). I liked Kiraku enough, although I think portioning our order for a full meal was challenging and we left a little hungry. I would recommend this place for izakaya-style nibbles with drinking, but I'd choose Ippuku if I'm hankering for a meal.

2012,"So I called this place to see if I can make reservation or to check out if it was busy or not. When I called around 7:45pm, the host stated that it was very crowded and reservation was the way to go. However, I had to spend a minimum of $30 per person. I found that really odd, but decided to do it anyways. My reservation was at 8:30pm and upon arriving the place was no where full. There was no waiting and a few empty tables. I was pretty annoyed of the situation, but made the best out of it (2 stars for that). My suggestion is to ask for a deposit and assess a cancellation fee, that's what many restaurant do.

The place was pretty loud, but decent ambiance. I ended up ordering the following:

1.) Takowasabi aka Octopus w/Wasabi: Way too salty for me, I only took one bite - portion was small (1 star)
2.) Karaage aka deep fried chicken: this was soo good, the chicken was very moist (5 stars)
3.) Boiled Chilean Seabass Ceviche: it was lacking sourness and the Seabass was pretty fishy (2 stars)
4.) Duck with Foie Gras: this was yummy, you definitely have to eat it together because separately it wasn't that flavorful (4 stars).
5.) Sashimi Combo (large): think it had tuna, salmon, hamachi and two other fishes. Overall, it was really fresh (4.5 stars).
6.) Roasted Tea blanc-Manger dessert: omg to die for. I loved it because it was not too sweet and the red bean complimented the dessert really well. I could eat two of this!!! (5 stars)

The braised oxtail was solid, and the tomato salsa was an unexpected addition of umami! Great with steamed rice.

The lotus chips were off the hook! Talk about great beer food, better than any potato chip, really.

We also had the chicken tendons which were okay, the breading was good, so I imagine the karaage is pretty damn good.

2011,"As always, skip to the bottom for quickie review.

I lived around the block on Parker until the end of June. What was here before was a halal Indian restaurant, and then just a failing, empty Indian restaurant for a year or so.

What it is now is a Japanese tapas restaurant. They have a plethora of menu options, with a sake menu which is just as impressive. I ordered a starter sampler, grilled hamachi, a house sake, and an Asahi [ON TAP!!!..much tastier than any bottled Asahi I've had].

The sampler includes a choice of three starters, which (in this case) included takowasabi (wasabi marinated octopus), spicy clams, and umesui (shark in a plum sauce). They also threw in a couple baby octopi. Needless to say, everything was perfectly balanced and so very tasty.

I finished off my sake with this and moved onto the grilled hamachi kama. WOW. I am someone who is omnivorous, but prefers fish over other animal protein, so I am quite particular about my fish. This piece was perfectly -- let me emphasize: PERFECTLY -- grilled. All in all a great meal.

The ambiance is welcoming, warm and tasteful. Simple dining area without clutter and gaudy nonsense. Just the clean basics and an inviting entrance. The staff is very attentive and offered a hot moist towel before I got to ordering. Asian food is plentiful in Berkeley, but exceptional, flavorful Asian food is not. This place is a Berkeley exception.

Bottomline: Perfect place to have a delicious meal whilst being enjoyably inebriated at the perfect level (Asian alcohols are on average at a lower alcohol proof so you get a healthy buzz without having to be too careful). Perfect for groups or an intimate date. On the pricier end, but you definitely get what you pay for, just be sure to get a bowl of rice for the extra carbs and you'll be good to go for a great experience.

The chicken cartilage karaage is awesome -- I love crunchy bits, and they do a great job with this dish, om nom nom.

Other favorites: the monk fish liver (not the best I've had, but better than most places), oyakodon (chicken/veggies/egg over rice) -- it's a small bowl, but it has so much incredible flavor, the ribs are fall off the bone good...what else did we have there...we had tons, haha.

2. STEWED OX TAIL: The broth was so rich and smooth! The meat was so soft that it crumbled and fell right off the bone!

3. DUCK AND FOIE GRAS: The duck was sliced thinly accompanied with a sweet hoisin-like sauce with small pieces of foie gras. This dish was super rich and savory!

Everything was awesome. I just wished I had a bowl of white rice with it to cut the richness. But it was well worth it! But please skip the Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage, wayyy too hard and chewy for me. I think it would have worked if they cut the pieces smaller or thinner. The seasoning on them were great though.

The Kiraku pork ribs were delicious. Soft, tender meat that was well-seasoned and went beautifully with a big bowl of white rice. The Chilean sea bass with ponzu sauce was also great. The ramen was basic, and not their most stand-out dish.

The grilled squid was also very well done. You could taste its freshness. Served whole and grilled, and paired with Japanese mayonnaise, the squid was a perfect appetizer for our meal.

The spicy Hamachi Kama was also great, as was the sea bass ceviche. Really fresh.

Every detail to this place deserve it's high ranking, from it's superb delicacies to the small details of having toothpick in the bathroom, Kiraku is a must place to visit for fellow foodies :D",5.0
2011,"4 stars kiraku... and you should consider dem' to be lucky ass stars as well.

The service was glacially slow, but i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they are brand spanking new.  However, with only two waitresses... i think this will be a problem in the future.  

This being my first trip here, i find the atmosphere to be pleasing, and the location solid as its located in a convenient location for students and non students alike.

The menu, although not extremely extensive in their selections, offered diverse choices in each category.  I thought the oyako don was especially good, and find it easy for most places to make decent versions, but difficult to find one that i especially like.  There is a good blend of tradition japanese offerings along with more fusion dishes.  

Even with the slow service, i believe i'll find myself within these cozy confines again, and that's the best endorsement i think i can give kiraku.  Since really, when you're starving... waiting for food isn't the best way to please customers.",4.0

2014,The service here is stunning and comparable to restaurants 5x the price. Try any of their duck plates.,4.0
2011,"The small, straight-forward and well-lit atmosphere makes you forget that it isn't your own cozy living room.   Though it only seats about 35 people, the menu is very extensive and constantly evolving with new dishes.  Definitely an izakaya as far as the variety of food and drinks offered.  

Plating is clean, yet elaborate; well balanced.  The chef is amazing with adding a twist on many traditional izakaya foods without damaging their original flavors and intentions.  

Perfect for a couple or large parties.  

Service is homely.  The the waitresses are always eager to make the dining experience as pleasant as possible.  The chef often comes out to talk to customer and is very open to comments and opinions.

The prices are very reasonable for the high-quality and quantity of food.  

Take advantage of this place before the 2011 school year starts and this place gets packed.  You'll have to go multiple times to try everything on the menu.  I am 75% through the entire menu and everything has been superb.

Opened till 2 am if necessary, this restaurant is a goldmine for thirsty, hungry night owls.",5.0
2012,"This is one of the best Japanese izakaya in the US!!  Small, crowded, loud and awesome -- just like an izakaya should be.  I'm only writing this review so I remember to go next time I'm in the bay area.

The chef is a Japanese chef, the sake selection is solid and the food is delicious.  Some of the more Americanized dishes were not my favorite, but Eric L. is right, the Asahi Draft is perfect.",5.0
2011,"The food was delicious (and really authentic), the service was awesome, and the check wasn't too bad, especially for a Japanese restaurant (which generally run on the pricey side). Portions are a little small, but my table had a single dish for each of us who were hungry, and the 8 of us collectively shared 2-4 small dishes (including eggplant, squid, and mackerel). That was enough to satisfy everyone.

I usually hate seafood, but I'm always eager to try new things. In this case, the latter overpowered the former and I'm glad it did. I was in for some very unfamiliar (but tasty) dishes unless you're REALLY keen on Japanese food. As much as I normally hate seafood, I'd even recommend the squid.

I had the Yuzu Chicken Udon and it was reasonably good, but a little bland, quite a far cry from the other dishes we got. Next time I'll probably try their Oyako-Don or just go with an array of small dishes to share.",4.0
2011,"I'm really sad this wasn't open when I was in school! I went here for a late dinner with a friend and everything we got was really good.

We got:

1) Chicken karaage -- our fav dish of our nice. it was nicely battered and piping hot
2) Chicken udon-- this was just okay, the broth was a little weak
3) hamachi kama--nicely grilled, just a tad salty

All in all, I highly recommended trying this place out. The only thing that made me take off a star is that the service is a little iffy sometimes and it is such a small place that the ambiance isn't the best. Also, make sure you make a reservation. I tried to come here one time and they said it was going to be a hour wait. The next time I tried to come, I made a reservation but pushed it back a couple times on the day (which they happily accommodated) and we were seated right away when we went to the restaurant (they seem to save tables for reservations). So, make sure to make reservations, or else you might have to wait a hour+!",4.0
2014,"One of my new favorite restaurants - everything we had was absolutely delicious, and the service was very friendly and efficient!  The only downside is it's a tiny place, so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time unless you want to wait.  We ordered sashimi, which is not the obvious choice in an izakaya restaurant, but was hands down some of the best sashimi I've ever had outside of Japan.  The waiter helped us pick a sake that was slightly sweet and mild and easy to drink, and I would definitely get that again.  It was called Dassai 50.  The grilled rice ball was perfectly crunchy on the outside and had a nice twist in flavor with the addition of shiso.  I'm partial to duck, so their duck dish hit the spot for me in terms of balancing flavor and fat.  The corn tempura did not disappoint, and I thought their uni-flavored crab broccolini salad was inspired and very good.  We also tried the fried stingray, which tasted like good fried fish.  After my friend mentioned it was her birthday, they put a candle in the grapefruit yogurt ice cream and sang happy birthday to her - which was a nice touch!  It was also a refreshing dessert that we truly enjoyed.  I have to really thank my friend for finding this place - it's a definite gem and I will be going back!",5.0
2015,"You had me at the foie gras.  So melt in your mouth deliciously good.  Contrasted with the slightly sweet, hoisin-style flavor sauce, this echos but  crushes ordinary flavors of Peking Duck.  Not too excited about the  daikon, accompaniment, but it cuts the richness.  I would think putting it on a bed of dandelion greens would be a better contrast.  Toro sashimi?  Outstanding quality.  The  luxurious belly rich fattiness was perfectly striated throughout  with a perfect firm, yet yielding texture.  Serious heaven.  Corn tempura?  I was disappointed that they did not use fresh corn off the cob, but what can you expect in February?  The texture of the corn itself had that thick skin frozen corn feel which brought it down a few notches for me.  The taste of the fritter, however,  is just like some of the Asian corn snacks, so they are highly addictive.  Yes, I agree - corn crack. The duck breast was cooked just through, with a roasted skin and savory sauce contrast with green onions for brightness and beautifully laid out.  The Wagu was done more like Carpaccio, and was super tasty, with a garlic accompaniment, but I thought could have been seared just a little bit more to bring out the full flavors of the wagu (to melt the fat) and get some roundness to the mouthfeel.   Still there was beauty in every bite.  Spicy Hamachi Kama - meh, that was good, but not knock your socks off like the others.  The Blanc Manger - roasted tea was right on the mark, not too sweet, but a nice finish to the evening.  The sweet potato crème brulee was so good you wanted to lick the ramekin clean.  Be prepared for art, both visually and in your mouth.   Go here.  You will love it.",5.0
2013,"Awesome staff! Super nice and funny, and even though it's busy they are on top of their game, keep their cool, and still manage to make you feel like all their attention is on you. I was able to try a bunch of the small tapas here-- they were all alright. The duck dumplings got cold way too fast. They had a gamey taste to them that only got stronger as they got colder. The deep fried chicken cartilage was interesting. It was too salty and the cartilage could be just a little less hard. It was too much effort to try and chew for me personally. The front door was left wide open (most likely for ventilation) even though it was cold outside. This just made all the food cold and therfore way less appetizing. The only thing that wowed me was the housemade tofu and the sweet potato brulee for dessert-- sooo good! Will go back just for those.",3.0
2011,"The service was just fantastic! This place is like the Japanese version of dim sum (yum cha for those that know what that is) lots of tiny bite sized servings. ok, I have a big mouth:)

Everything we ordered was just delicious. Grilled octopus, grilled eggplant, the salad, this corn pancake thing (YUM!) The agadashi tofu was pretty good. Sashimi tasted fresh.

It's very casual & I didn't realise it was. I'll be back!",4.0
2013,"Love love love this place. Everything I have had here every time is delicious, fresh, and high quality. The service is friendly and efficient. Parking around Telegraph is not bad around dinner time. It does get crowded and the space is small, so expect a line on weekends. $40 (without drinks) will easily fill two hungry people. Last night, after we scraped out the black garlic from the bone marrow, and polished off the chicken karage, the moist grilled mackerel (and I usually don't like mackerel), Osaka style taro, and fried rice with pickled vegetables, I felt lucky to have a tasty izakaya restaurant like this in the area. Ippuku is a cruel joke compared to Kiraku.",5.0

The food = sublime, creative, and adventurous (don't worry, there are wealth of more accessible and less adventurous items on the menu -- all outstanding).  Izakaya (Japanese ""tapas"" with traditional Japanese distilled drinks, beer, and/or sake) is becoming a trend and I am TOTALLY in favor of that -- Kiraku is the best example of this japanese standard that I've found.",5.0
2013,"This is a very good Izakaya style restaurant.  The concept is a menu of dishes that on their own would be insufficient as a meal, but when ordered in groups is quite filling.

2011,"Through some sweet connections, I was very lucky to have had a private dinner at Kiraku before it even opened.  I don't make it out to Berkeley often, but I'm glad I did for this dinner.

Service: the service was great! Very friendly and incredibly accommodating, despite the embarrassing level of drunkenness some people had achieved that night.

Food: I'm not even sure where to start.  The food is very much Japanese influenced but has its own special twists.  My absolute favorite of the evening was balsimic braised/roasted pork belly. It was divine!  The spinach salad came with nice plump cubed pieces of bacon and parmesan cheese.  The chef's specialty is his style of okonomiyaki, which, rather than mixing all the components (cabbage, pork) into the batter, he wraps it all up in a thin pancake (or egg?).  In any case, it was awesome.  The lotus chips to start were fantastically crispy too.

The ramen was also delicious and well worth the wait until the end of the evening.  We tried several and I can't list them all here, but I definitely had to hold back from grabbing more for myself (we had it all served family style).  

The room full of people from Japan all approved of the food.  The menu is creative and also executed very well.  I highly recommend Kiraku and hope to come back soon.",4.0
2012,"I wish I was hungry when I came here!

Stopped by with a friend who comes here so often after work that he knows the owners and has had everything on the menu.  I was craving something sweet and had the roasted tea blanc-mange, but also tried the wasabi octopus, nasu miso (eggplant), and french fries (haha).  The blanc-mange was good but not really sweet at all, which is not really a complaint since I should've known not to expect a super sweet Japanese dessert.  The wasabi octopus was so good!  Salty with a wasabi punch, but the entire portion is tiny, maybe a couple of tablespoons worth.  The eggplant was very good as well and may have been slightly sweeter than my dessert!  Fries are very crispy, which is not really my thing, but they are cooked well.  Come here if you like really crispy fries!

Very good for late night snacks since portion sizes are on the small side...but you shouldn't be eating that much late at night anyway!",4.0
2012,"I really enjoyed my experience here, even though I wasn't old enough to drink at the time. The food is good, but don't come here looking to get full. It's an izakaya so they only serve small dishes that are meant to be snacked on in between rounds of drinks. With that said, feel free to order a bunch of things from the menu to share. My personal favorite was the shrimp mayo. The service was fantastic.",4.0

2012,"Went cause my brother was excited to try it. Highly reviewed by foodie friends and yelp. Told to order min 2 order of corn cakes/best thing on earth. They won't take reservations unless you eat min $30 per person and drink heavily (yes, the staff saids that). So, we went with high expectations. 3 empty tables, we were next in line. Waited 40 min. Went next door to vietnamese place to eat ...
noodles and fish cake. Afterwards went back in line to wait some more. Finally get seated (3 tables were still empty). Order multiple orders of corn cakes and recommendations from friends and waitress. 10 dish total. turns out that japanese tapas are not small plates, but full size meals. So there's 3 of us with lots of food. But not good food. Corn cakes are tasteless balls of dough with corn. no flavor or seasoning. Everything else was the same. Really odd odd stuff. no flavor, but the place is packed. go figure. Maybe foodies know something that I don't know. The fish cake and noodles next door were a lot better. Potentially one of the worst food I've ever had. Maybe they were having an off nite. Don't know, but will not be going back.

2011,"Kiraku was a pleasant surprise. We showed up without a reservation, which meant we had to wait 5 or 10 minutes for a table so if you decide to come here, make a reservation because it's a small place and they may not always be able to accommodate walk ins.. Luckily, we got a table and the food we ordered was all tasty. We had the corn tempura, grilled black cod, salmon carpaccio, shrimp mayo, and the fried chicken cartilage.

The salmon was tasty, but the toppings it came with were lacking some flavor. The corn was also good but just filling. One order of it comes with four large fried corn patties, so I had one but didn't want to waste the rest of my appetite on it. One of my favorite izakaya items is the fried chicken cartilage, or nankotsu. It might be off putting for Americans who aren't used to it, but it's just extra crunchy chicken that doesn't taste burned. Squirt the lemon on it and give it a try, it's really tasty. The Asahi on tap was also nice, very refreshing after a long day. The price does start to add up when you get a few dishes and drinks, but it's good quality and less arrogant than Ippuku.",4.0

2012,"I wish this place was around when I was in college! This is the Musha of Berkeley! Weeee (Musha is my favorite izakaya in my hometown). Basically, an izakaya is a Japanese drinking establishment that serves food too. Therefore these dishes are usually on the smaller side. What I really liked about Kiraku was that their dishes are so unique! Everything was a fusion of a familiar Japanese dish. Yet, the 'fusion' didn't take away from the authenticity.

There were so many dishes that I wanted to try (and luckily got to), but if you're here with a small group here's what I recommend in order so you can choose top 4, or top 5, etc. :D If you want more than 10, I'd say that you're safe with any of the 'fried'. Kiraku seems to of a really good job with their fried dishes. Oh, and portion size is small. You want to order at least 2 per person.  

1) CORN TEMPURA W/GREEN TEA SALT. Omg what is this?? The name is exactly what is it. haha. I don't think I've ever had corn tempura, but I'm pretty sure that Kiraku's corn tempura will always be my favorite.
2) KARAAGE (fried chicken). Fried to perfection. The outside was crispy and the inside was soft. I loved how the 'bite-sized' chicken pieces are actually like 3-4 bites! hehe.
3) OMELET SALAD. This seems to be a twist on the traditional okonomiyaki. All the ingredients in an okonomiyaki is separated. The cabbage layered with pro slices wrapped in egg and topped with mayo and otafuku.
4) SHRIMP MAYO. Despite it being drenched with spicy mayo sauce, the shrimp remains crispy and the mayo doesn't make the dish salty or too saucy at all.
5) SEA BASS CEVICHE. Fresh ingredients. :D
6) NASU MISO (eggplant). Caramalized eggplant. Don't let the 'miso' throw you off. It's like soft eggplant candy.
7) BUTA-KIM. This was basically Korean kimchicheegae.
8) KIRAGU RIB. This was pretty good. And one of the larger portioned dishes. I didn't find it too memorable though. It had a slight burnt taste.. :/
9) CARTILAGE (friend chicken cartilage). Yeah, not the biggest fan of cartilage, but my friends seemed to enjoy it a lot.
10) dessert: BLANC MANGER, SWEET POTATO BRULEE, ICE CREAM. They're good but I wouldn't get dessert over an actually dish. Lucky for me after my meal, I got  all three for FREEEEE! :D

And I almost forgot, service here is really, really great. The waitresses are so attentive and always ready to take orders in between my meals, so I can order like 2 dishes at a time. Food also comes out fairly quickly. Make sure you tip well. :D",5.0
2011,"This is our new favorite Japanese izakaya and I would say Japanese restaurant in Berkeley in general.

Typically we go to O' Chame for lunch or Ippuku (for yakitori,) but when we found out our favorite waitress from Sumika and Kokko would open a Japanese restaurant, we knew it would be good.

Sai Sai and her husband, a former chef from Jin Sho in Palo Alto and Kokko opened up about a month ago and they created a really nice menu that brings out the best of all the places we've been to. The quality of ingredients is quite good, but the prices are much more reasonable.

They have done a really good job with the space they rented on Telegraph and have made it cozy, hip, and inviting.

You do want to make reservations because it is a smaller space (probably seats 30 or 40 at  a time.) When we were there Saturday night, they had to turn away several parties around 7pm who expected to get walk-in tables.  So don't expect that because they are new, you can just come: I think enough people have heard about this gem and it's getting harder.

The food is definitely pricey but the quality is really good and its delicious!
From my few times there here are somethings I would definitely recommend:
Homemade tofu: if you like tofu order this! It's very clean tasting and light. It has the original tofu flavor
Pork belly skewer: at $3 a skewer it's pretty expensive but its so yummy! It's not even that fatty! It's seasoned with salt and pepper and comes with a dollop of miso paste. The miso paste is good but can make it too salty to eat it with caution!
Beef sirloin skewer: tender and full of pure beef flavor
Corn tempura: seems so simple but it's definitely good. Crispy and salty on the outside, but sweet and juicy on the inside. The green tea salt can be to salty but it's still delicious
Lotus root chips with celery salt: I love this dish because the salt is just so creative. It's quite a subtle flavor but its there. The chips are sooooo good
Roasted duck: Oh my I almost forgot about the duck. The way they prepared it is really perfect. The skin is crispy, but the meat is tender and a bit pink in the center.
Salmon sashimi: fresh and melts in your mouth

2012,"The food was good. But there were 2 things that kind of annoyed me, and I don't know if I'd come back because of these..

1. If you make a reservation, there's a $30 minimum order per person. I think that's a little too high. $20 would've been fine, but $30? AND in the middle of us eating, the waitress came up to us to order more to up the bill. We weren't done ordering (still waiting on one more person) so it just left a bad taste in my mouth.

2. When we paid the bill it was cash + credit card. They took it, came back and said, we can only take one form of payment. Hmm, ok. It's not that hard..but I guess I've never worked in the restaurant industry to know much about how it all works.

Maybe I'm being picky, and maybe I don't appreciate food enough to know that the great food here overrides all that. I still don't like these ""rules.""",2.0
2012,I love it! The food was very tasty. The portions were bigger than I expected. My first experience with Japanese Tapas were at Ippuku and they had smaller portions.

2012,"Went by a couple of nights ago. Got there around 9:50pm. Supposedly, they were closing at 10:30pm. So, I was a bit worried that I'd feel rushed. However, it was a non-issue as we ate and chatted and stayed along with a couple of other tables well beyond their advertised closing hours. Not once did the staff make me feel rushed. I very much appreciated their service.

Overall, the food was good. However, the Chilean Sea Bass Ceviche was a letdown. Perhaps, this was based on my preconception of what a ceviche should be like. However, when you describe something as being a ceviche I expect it to be like...well....a ceviche. Their version seemed like it was practically cooked/blanched/boiled. The only reasonable explanation I could come up with was that the fish had been soaking in its sauce or citrus for too long.

Still, I would not hesitate to go back and try other items on their menu.",3.0
2011,"Went here in the beginning of November for a friends birthday and it was excellent! We ordered:

-Tsunami Sampler w/Sake Pickles, Iidako, and Sake Thief. Overall, the starter was good and refreshing.

-Lotus Roots Chips, pretty standard. Sliced thinly and not too oily.
-Agedashi Tofu, pretty standard as well. I did like the sauce it was served in.
-Corn Tempura, was excellent! I loved the green tea salt with it and the corn was light, crispy, and crunchy. We ordered one and they gave us an extra one for free which was a nice surprise.
-Cartilage, little popcorn chicken size nuggets of chicken cartilage. Not on a lot of menus and it was a good surprise in the meal.

-Balsamico Pumpkin, sweet and savory.
-Menma, love love loved these.
-Nasu Miso, I have a soft spot for eggplant so I enjoyed this dish a lot.
-Spicy Tuna Tartare, its a tartare. Sashimi was fresh and tasted great.
-Salmon Carpaccio, one of my favorites for the night. They took beef carpaccio and put a japanese twist on it and it turned out great. I loved the fresh basil taste that was sorta cooling and you ate it.
-Balsamico Pork, good nothing too special but not bad.
-Stewed Oxtail, this was a hit. Warm and hearty and definitely a great addition to the meal.
-Foie Gras Daikon, an slightly unusual combination but overall the dish was great.
-Foie Gras w/Duck Breast, we got two foie gras dishes so they plated it together. It was like an orgy of duck, liver, and daikon on one plate. I preferred the dish with daikon over the dish with duck breast just because I liked the crispy crunch from the daikon.

-Hamachi Kama Spicy, good grilled fish. Nothing too special but still none the less good.

Ramen (2 orders), good clean broth. Nice end to the meal even though we were practically stuffed.  
Yuzu Chicken Udon, nice citrus taste and not too heavy.

We also ordered two or three pitchers of beer at 15 bucks each.

Our grand total at the end of the night was around 250 with tip. There were 5 of us eating and it was slightly on the pricier side, but we did not go home hungry. I was stuffed from dinner.

I enjoyed the tapas style atmosphere of the place because you are able to order a ton of stuff and share it all with everyone. Our waitress was also super nice and even went out of her way to sneak the bill to our table so the person who's birthday it was wouldn't know that we had paid already. Overall, the atmosphere was great (its a tiny place so I recommend making a reservation, we did and it was worth it). I will definitely be going back to Kiraku for the great food!",5.0

2012,"Had several dishes here... my favorite being the karaage (I know, simple pleasures). The crazy Asahi beer tap made the creamiest and slightly salty (no lie) head I've ever tasted (okay, that sounded awkward). The fried rice was dry-ish and did not need the lettuce (it's pointless filler in general). Assorted other dishes I can't recall exactly (wasabi octopus, two kinds of fish, chicken udon, two kinds of salads, some kimchee with pork, etc)... all good but nothing exceptionally memorable.",3.0
2012,"I absolutely love this place. This isn't a place for sushi but a place for small Japanese plates (tapa style). Pretty much everything I've ordered here has been good if not delicious (not too fond of the fried garlic or the buta kim though). They seem to have different daily specials but there are a few items I always get when I come here. The corn tempura with green tea salt is a nice treat, as well as the oxtail stew. This isn't a ramen house but the ramen here tastes more fresh than most of the places I've tried in the area. We got some kind of ribs with marmalade and it the meat was melting off the bone. So so good! It's a great place to go with a date or 2 other people. The place is pretty small and it can get pretty packed at peak times. If you have to wait, expect the wait to be long.",5.0
2012,"Now that I've eaten here once a week for the last month and fully satiated, I can finally share Kiraku with the world. ;-) Let's just say the restaurant is small, so I hesitated about sharing it with other yelpers.

At first glance, I thought the restaurant's decor was blah. But when our food started arriving, I completely forgot about the decor and lost myself in the food. We had their fries, duck with and w/o foie gras, various sashimi, corn tempura, ramen, cabbage omelet, octopus salad, grilled squid, and some of their vegetable side dishes. Their fries are truly outstanding and must be ordered. One time, we ordered it twice because it was so good. I don't know if it's the cooking method, the oil, or what, but it's the best fries I have ever had. Their duck dish is also outstanding and perfectly medium rare. Initially, I thought the octopus salad was a bit strange with the gooey texture, but it grew on me. The only items I thought was just okay was the sashimi. I also like the fact that the dishes come out one by one, so that I can concentrate on one dish at a time. One time, everything came out together, and I didn't enjoy it as much.

When the food is so good, who cares about the decor. I also think it's what keeps the food price reasonable.

I'm already dreaming about coming back here on Friday with friends and munching my way through the menu.",4.0
2015,"Food was very good; we got a sashimi sampler, corn tempura and baked scallops, all delicious. Unfortunately the service is a bit chaotic and random. Some tables have great service but a few get overlooked. I saw a table that came in 30 minutes after us served 3 dishes in the time we were waiting for our second, and saw people who ordered the same dish after us served first. No organization and we ended up walking out 50 bucks later still hungry.  The food is good enough that I would recommend you try your luck-- you might just be one of those tables blessed with good service.",3.0

2015,"Went here for the second time expecting similar results. Unfortunately, this time I was not impressed. Waited almost an hour for our table which would not have been annoying but for the fact that it was apparent the chefs friends were let in ahead of us. The young kids proceeded to do sake shots with not only the chef but the waitress.  The one positive was that the food was delivered quickly however the quality was not nearly up to par of my first visit. The broccoli  anchovy was overcooked and the sashimi plate was $43 which was very excessive given the 15 very thin slices of sashimi.  Rather shocking to get your bill and see that the ""specialty sashimi dish was $43.  I think with that price point the waitress should say something when you order the dish given their other sashimi dishes are proximally $12.  Cost aside, quality of food was just not as good as last time.  Karaage chicken also was disappointing and rather greasy.  I must say that they are Asahi draft is fantastic",3.0

NOOOOOO!!!!! But I still love this place. Best tonkatsu in Berkeley and the corn tempura is great. I can't really go there often because I have two young kids, but whenever they are not too busy I order out from them.

You'll find the typical Japanese service and attitude from the staff: attentive, proud of their service, and never condescending. There are a lot of off menu items that you can order, and anything you ask them to make, they'll do a great job.

2011,"Date/Time:  Friday - 7:30pm
Occasion:   Catch dinner with one the bestest
Party of:  Two
Ordered:  sashimi salad, garlic buttered corn, salted hamachi kama, buta kim, flat iron steak with mushroom sauce, and fresh made yuzu ice cream
Total incl gratuity: $80

Was recommended from a fellow yelper to check out Kiraku and so I did.  A girlfriend of mine wanted to take me out for a belated birthday dinner so we met here at Kiraku.

The food is prepared extremely well - perfectly cooked and seasoned properly.  We started with the sashimi salad.  A nice portion of fresh tuna, salmon, and seaweed salad.  The garlic buttered corn was simply to die for.  It was served hot with a heart-scoop of butter garlic atop of the corn, which is then mixed into the vegetables.  It was so heavenly and rich in flavor.   The hamachi kama was also very good, grilled to perfection with a nice brine flavor.  Although we must have received a really boney part of the fish because it had very little ""meat"" to it.  I felt like we were really picking at the bones to get any of the substance.  My least favorite dish probably was the buta kim.  Not that it wasn't tasty but it did pale in comparison to the other dishes.  The pork, while flavored nicely, was a bit on the dry side for my taste.  It was served with kimchee - a tasty addition.  Our final entree was the flat iron steak.  It was served sliced and smothered in the mushroom sauce.  I was pretty blown away.  It was very tender and I could certainly taste the seasoned yet gently charred flavor.  It did not disappoint.  

We ended our meal by ordering a palate cleansing dessert: freshly made yuzu ice cream.  It was light and citrus-y, just what we needed after a delicious and rich meal.  

Overall, the food I found to be very satisfying.  Unfortunately, the service seemed a bit rookie to me.  The servers were a slow and not attentive.  We had to wave them down for most everything, including removing our empty dishes from our table.  Nonetheless, I am a fan of their food and will likely return soon.",4.0
2012,I used to live in North Berkeley and I have never been to this place.  I thought Kirala was pretty good but this is absolutely better and hello..authentic.  The Chefs are all Japanese!  It's a fun place but can be totally packed.  I like how there is no closing time!  They offer an array of small plates that are authentic if not unique.  Fried chicken cartilage..sounds fear factor-ish but with a side of Asahi..good times!  This is definitely a fun drinking place...gonna be a regular here!,5.0
2012,"Great kitchen; bar is probably good though we didn't drink alcohol.   Three of us shared dishes from the regular and special menus:

Sweet and sour sea bass was battered and deep fried, served cold, mildly rice vinegar seasoned and not too sweet.  Delicious, savory flavor.

Spicy jellyfish was a tad salty and similar to Chinese appetizer.  

Kobe beef cubes probably weren't Kobe and were slightly tough, but sauteed onion, dried garlic and green onion accompaniments and sauce were excellent.   Served sizzling on a very small iron pan.

Deep fried fish cakes were hot, dense and flavorful due to tasty ingredients more than seasoning.

Orange marmalade pork ribs were very tender, perfectly seasoned, excellent, possibly my favorite dish.

Tongue was gone by the late time we got there.

Dozens of other interesting dishes would be fun to try next time.

Everything was mildly but perfectly seasoned aside from a little too much salt on the jellyfish, ingredients and cooking were excellent.  Like Alice Waters, the mild seasoning and perfect cooking lets the flavor of the ingredients come through very well.  Small plate format is great for sharing and trying many different dishes.  Kiraku is a gem that exists for the love of food.  Thank you for a wonderful meal.",5.0
2012,"i really like this Japanese restaurant. Most of their dishes are tapas, so the portion size is kind of small. The food though is really good. I got some appetizers and some grilled plates. I really love the grilled ribs. They were very tasty and tender. The meat practically fell off the bone. It was amazing. I also really liked the squid and Agedashi tofu. For dessert, I had the grapefruit ice cream. It seems like they make it themselves, and I absolutely loved it. Overall, I had a really great experience here. The server was really nice and attentive. There was always a constant flow of food, so we were eating pretty much the whole time which is fine with me!",5.0

2) sea bass

worst things:
1) buta-kim

3) chicken karaage

My reasoning for 3 is that the chicken isn't bite-sized, it's much larger. it takes an awkward number of bites to eat it, which bothers me because i'm super anal like that. The chicken itself is dark meat which means its very moist but it just didn't taste all that flavorful.",4.0

I would basically call the food Japanese tapas - but not sushi. We got a spicy shrimp dish that was awesome.

The style is cool, felt very authentic Japanese (although I have never been to Japan to compare...), and the staff was warm and attentive.

The only reason I didn't give the place 5-stars is because I thought it was a bit pricey  - and we didn't even eat a whole meal.

Well definitely go back, but more for drinks and snacks than for a sit down type meal.",4.0
2011,"Really good, authentic and reasonably priced Japanese fare.

Have the grilled mackerel - incredible.

The staff made such an effort. Our mackerel was delayed (but it was totally worth the wait) and they were falling over themselves to apologise. We ended up with a seaweed appetizer and dessert on the house.

It only doesn't get a fifth star because we could have done with a bit more explanation of how much to order and what dishes complement each other (it's a bit like tapas rather than courses) - go with a Japanese friend if you can!",4.0

2012,"Found this place on Yelp and had high hopes, due to the high ratings. What a disappointment. (I wasn't nearly as unhappy as my companion, who wanted to give 2 stars, but he can write his own review.)

Sashimi was butter-tender and fresh, and the duck breast was perfectly cooked and flavorful, but barely warm. There was some kind of wrap-your-own spicy tuna roll with quail egg, which was not spicy enough, and the nori was full of holes so everything got all over your hands. Anchovy broccoli was under-cooked - needed to be less crunchy in order to cook the bitterness out. Duck and sweetbread cabbage roll was much too bland, and not tasting much of duck, sweetbread or even cabbage; tasted mostly of the strange marinara-like sauce (which I would have left off if the remaining stuff had had enough flavor.)

Service was extremely inattentive. Our teacups were always empty, and (after being there over 1.5 hours) they attempted to give us the check while we were still waiting for one of our dishes. They probably thought we'd been sitting there too long, and I'd agree, except that in that time they'd only managed to serve us 4 little dishes and we were still hungry.",3.0

Their tapas were very good as always, I would higly recommend their sashimi salad (the dressing is very tasty), chazuke (rice in dashi broth), roasted duck, cold tofu, deep fried fish cakes, and saefood donburi (it's excellent! it's crab meat, salmon roes, salmon, uni over rice). The only complaint is that they don't have this on their regular menu, it was on their daily special menu only. I really  hope they can put it on their regular menu.

luckily, my boss suggested it for my bday celebration this year, and me, her, and 2 other coworkers were able to enjoy a good number of tasty dishes. my boss told me to go crazy with the ordering, and i did just that!

alas, there were some things we ordered that came from the specials menu so i don't know what those things were.

1. duck and foie gras (specials) - the foie gras was good, but the duck was even better. i'm not even sure how to describe it so u'll just have to order it.
2. fermented firefly squid - definitely different from other squid i've had, but with the expected chewy texture. very easy to eat if ur not afraid of the fermented taste.
3. dried fish roe - yummy! it's essentially little rectangular blocks of dried roe and the saltiness is cut with a bite of the radish that comes with it. i could eat that row forever. chewy goodness.
4. boiled baby octopus - not merely boiled b/c it does have some kind of sauce on it. very tasty.
5. hamachi kama (spicy) - i'd have to say i've had better here. for some reason, the meat wasn't as tender as i'd expected it to be.
6. black cod with sake lees - really really enjoyed this dish.  soft fish flesh marinated in sake and u can just taste the flavor.
7. homemade tofu - looks like ricotta cheese but tastes like creamy tofu.
8. agedashi tofu - it was good, but the coating outside the tofu was a little too ... soft for me?

2013,"In order to enjoy Kirako you need to come hungry and you need to order lots of different dishes. But don't come here seeking sushi because they don't serve it. This is a tapas bar so the menu is extensive but the portions can be small. However, there are some truly unique items to be had here. The corn fritters are by far a signature dish that shouldn't be missed and their black cod was incredibly delicious but the portion was miniscule considering it costs $14. But Kirakus is a great place to order beer by the pitcher and sit with friends while sampling a wide variety of Japanese dishes. It won't be a cheap evening out but you're sure to have a good time and great food. Probably the biggest down side to Kiraku is it's size, it's quite a tiny (albeit cozy) place. Because of this, it's not good for large groups and your wait for a table is likely to be in the 45 minutes to 1 hr range. They ~DO~ take reservations but as another reviewer has mentioned, you'll need to spend at least  $30 per person, but don't worry, that's easily accomplished here at Kiraku.

2011,"Having seen the fine Yelp reviews, decided to try Kiraku Monday evening.  We went with another couple and had a wonderful meal.  The chef/owner came out and helped us select an assortment of shochus.

As noted the service is friendly but a bit disorganized.

All of the dishes were outstanding, including the fried chicken cartilage.  It was crispy on the outside and crunchy on the inside.  It tasted like they used the cartilage joints from chicken legs.

The grilled squid was seared long enough to be cooked, without turning chewy or tough.  The boiled seabass was served at room temperature with a very nice sauce.   The hamachi and mackerel were very tasty, although the hamachi collar was a bit awkward to break up between four of us.

The corn tempura was the best corn fritter I've ever tasted.  They could make a small fortune by taking this on the county fair circuit.

The only disappointment was the special ""grilled broad beans"", which consisted of 4 grilled large fava bean pods with a very nice salt on the side.  We felt these were over-priced.

The restaurant has an authentic feel and the food even more so.  I had the Balsamico Pork and it was DELICIOUS!  It had fresh chopped bell peppers, purple onions, and generous pieces of pork all marinated in a sweet and sour balsamic vinaigrette.  The Oyako-don was ok, a little bland for my taste, but still good enough for me to devour the whole thing.

It was definitely a pleasant surprise to be generously given free edamame.  But it wasn't just some edamame dumped into a bowl that everyone gets (though it looked like everyone did receive them).  These edamame were a house specialty!  They roasted garlic and then cooked the edamame in the roasted garlic.  It was delicious!

Between two entrees, two beers, and a very tasty appetizer of spicy bamboo shoots (TRY THIS), the tab was only $32 (keep in mind how much TWO TALL beers usually costs in a restaurant).  Plus the free tasty edamame.  Not bad at all.

Between the good service, the great food, and the fact that I got greeted and talked to by the owner, I'd definitely recommend going here.  The menu changes frequently, so you should give the owner your input about the food.  If it weren't so far from the east bay, I'd go all the time!",5.0
2011,"Their menu has a plenty of variety.  The food is unique, creative and delicious.  They also have regular Japanese pub food too.  
They also have a pretty good selection of sake and shochu...and draft of Japanese beers.  

It reminds me of the local restaurants /Izakaya from my hometown outside of Tokyo.... and I love it!",5.0
2013,Their restaurant is my to go place. We love their food and their staff. The owner's wife is the sweetest person in the world. She is pregnant and still working almost everyday! We especially love their Tuna yamakaki don (tuna mountain yam rice bowl)! I can eat this everyday! (for real!) Yeah to the yummy japanese neighbor food in Berkeley!,4.0
2013,"Lucked out! our party of 4 was seated right away on a Thursday (4/18/13) about 8pm. Our  server didn't know much about about the more unusual items on the menu.., but was a sweetheart.Had the Asahi draft beer yum & cold sake yum. had the 3 sampler starter of wasabi octopus (no one liked it except me). pickled Takana leaves fine, & (we were served) the boiled baby octopus (good) (instead of spicy cod roe we ordered..we said nothing though)..duck gyoza fine, beef tenderloin tataki great as well as the amberjack? sashimi, unanimously, the best item we had , hamachi kama; great buts it's always great to me..spinach fine, weird omelet salad ok, fried chicken karaage crispy tasty, grilled miso rice ball ok but bit salty as was our finisher ...2 bowls of ramen;; great springy noodles but the broth was, besides salty, simply one dimensional..the hard boiled egg in it way overcooked! pork belly so so.. compared to the very unadorned (but deeply flavored broth in the) ramen at Ippuku on Center St, it didn't hold a candle! our bill was $188 until I noticed they charged us for a $20 pitcher of beer we didn't order or drink..our  server was very apologetic and deleted it  I  would return but don't think it's in the same league with Ippuko or B Dama",3.0
2012,Interesting eats for American standards. Reminds me of typical Japanese pub food.  A bit expensive because you order so many dishes. The did a nice Birthday treat for my friend with chocolate writting on the plate. Don't expect them to bug you while you eat. You are supposed to take your time and call on them when you need assistance. Had a great time.,4.0
2011,Better for vegetarians than it looks. Phenomenal for people who eat meat. Get the sweet potato brulee for dessert.,5.0

2014,"great food in tapa style, great sake, and the sake glasses were made by the owner(?) himself. place is very small, i recommend a reservation. good for 2-3 person table max. they even serve green tea at the end of your meal-loved it.",5.0

2013,"This place has pretty much redefined Japanese food in a completely different light. Kiraku has taken the usual flavors of Japanese cuisine and tweaked it completely by putting Spanish tapas terms with it. The results were phenomenal. My favorites were probably deep chicken cartilage, salmon carpaccio, the black pork belly, beef intestines, and the corn tempura with green tea salt.",4.0
2011,"Having almost given up on ever finding a good Japanese restaurant in the Berkeley area (that is not Ippuku), my wife and I were delighted to chance upon this gem that reminded us of the places we frequented while living in Tokyo.  

The draft beer with a cappuccino-esque head, the light/airy karaage that almost melts with flavor, and the plethora of unique twists on the izakaya menu were enough for us to know that we'd finally found ""the place.""

Given its proximity to the university, its understandable that there were number of students there, and the price was relatively inexpensive given level of execution.

Finally, be sure to save room for the sweet potato brulee.  Trust me.",5.0
2011,Everything I had was delicious except for the deep fried chicken cartilage.  Too chewy for my taste.  The salmon was perfect as well as the prawns.  The oxtail soup was divine and so was the duck and foie gras.  Definitely a spot I will hit up again.,4.0
2012,"Found this place on Yelp and had high hopes, due to the high ratings. What a disappointment. (I wasn't nearly as unhappy as my companion, who wanted to give 2 stars, but he can write his own review.)

Sashimi was butter-tender and fresh, and the duck breast was perfectly cooked and flavorful, but barely warm. There was some kind of wrap-your-own spicy tuna roll with quail egg, which was not spicy enough, and the nori was full of holes so everything got all over your hands. Anchovy broccoli was under-cooked - needed to be less crunchy in order to cook the bitterness out. Duck and sweetbread cabbage roll was much too bland, and not tasting much of duck, sweetbread or even cabbage; tasted mostly of the strange marinara-like sauce (which I would have left off if the remaining stuff had had enough flavor.)

Service was extremely inattentive. Our teacups were always empty, and (after being there over 1.5 hours) they attempted to give us the check while we were still waiting for one of our dishes. They probably thought we'd been sitting there too long, and I'd agree, except that in that time they'd only managed to serve us 4 little dishes and we were still hungry.",3.0
2014,"I came here a few times and it never disappoints me. I usaually get there early before 6pm, no need to wait. I went there again last Sunday at about 7:30 so we wait for about an hour, but it really worths the wait (they can actually take reservation). Their tapas were very good as always, I would higly recommend their sashimi salad (the dressing is very tasty), chazuke (rice in dashi broth), roasted duck, cold tofu, deep fried fish cakes, and saefood donburi (it's excellent! it's crab meat, salmon roes, salmon, uni over rice). The only complaint is that they don't have this on their regular menu, it was on their daily special menu only. I really  hope they can put it on their regular menu. Btw, their services were also excellent, they all have warm and friendly smiles on their faces.",5.0
2011,"The food is great!  Their sea salt is amazing!  Please note that the service is slow, but it is because the pace is that of a fine dinning restaurant.  Once again, the place is expensive and the portions are small, but it is because one is meant to have many small dishes during their meal there.  To experience the full pleasures of this restaurant, one should expect to spend at lease 2 hours there.  And please note one, or even two, orders of anything will not be enough.  Also the staff is extremely welcoming and nice, and their bathrooms are amazing!!!",4.0
2013,it's the most authentic izakaya in the East Bay ... quite possibly even all of San Francisco!,5.0
2014,"Food was great. The special dishes were a bit pricy. The place was noisy for a japanese restaurant (-1 star). Overall, this place is much better than Ippuku.",4.0
2013,"i've been wanting to try this place since last year when i first heard about it. however, i knew that despite the $$ rating, the fact that it was tapas would leave me broke after i finished ordering what i wanted to try (almost everything).

luckily, my boss suggested it for my bday celebration this year, and me, her, and 2 other coworkers were able to enjoy a good number of tasty dishes. my boss told me to go crazy with the ordering, and i did just that!

alas, there were some things we ordered that came from the specials menu so i don't know what those things were.

1. duck and foie gras (specials) - the foie gras was good, but the duck was even better. i'm not even sure how to describe it so u'll just have to order it.
2. fermented firefly squid - definitely different from other squid i've had, but with the expected chewy texture. very easy to eat if ur not afraid of the fermented taste.
3. dried fish roe - yummy! it's essentially little rectangular blocks of dried roe and the saltiness is cut with a bite of the radish that comes with it. i could eat that row forever. chewy goodness.
4. boiled baby octopus - not merely boiled b/c it does have some kind of sauce on it. very tasty.
5. hamachi kama (spicy) - i'd have to say i've had better here. for some reason, the meat wasn't as tender as i'd expected it to be.
6. black cod with sake lees - really really enjoyed this dish.  soft fish flesh marinated in sake and u can just taste the flavor.
7. homemade tofu - looks like ricotta cheese but tastes like creamy tofu.
8. agedashi tofu - it was good, but the coating outside the tofu was a little too ... soft for me?
[we had other things as well, but unfortunately, i forgot to write this down and now, nearly a year later, i can't remember...]

and can i say that the service was absolutely great? both the owners, husband and wife, were super nice, and attentive.",5.0

2011,"This is the place for you if you need a descent satisfaction for your izakaya craving. The food is wonderful here, there's a good selection of sake/drinks (with fresh Asahi on tap), and you can't go wrong with whatever you order. It was our first time here, but consider that we spent $135 for just two people, you can probably tell that we loved this place. We definitely ordered too much food, but we couldn't help finishing it all! Just remember, it isn't cheap, but it's well worth it. Make reservations if you have a bigger party than 4.",5.0

Had duck confit, roast duck, roast jumbo squid, Kiraku salad, sashimi salad and some beee-ya (asahi on draft). The duck confit was something sent from heaven. The squid was outstanding as well. I usually rate on food quality alone unless the service is negligent... But I must emphasize that the dining experience was elevated by the staff. The chef came out to our table, and recommended a dish. The servers were one step ahead and very friendly and competent. This place rules! I can't wait to try the desserts. Until next time...",5.0
2011,"Outstanding food and drinks.  Each dish was perfectly flavored and prepared.  We had the corn tempera, balsamico pork, grilled hamachi, and wasabi octopus.  The sweet sake was cold and refreshing.  The service was friendly and prompt.  I'll definitely be back again.  Oh and make sure you check out the specials - a wonderful indulgence.",5.0
2013,"do plan on waiting and for sure if you can just e-mail them to set up a reservation. it's totally worth it. small plates but japanese style, the chef is amazing and so is the staff. friendly and knowledgeable of the Soju. We loved one of the bottles so much we bought it and they have it reserved ready for us every time we come back!",5.0
2011,I love izakaya restaurants being a night owl and this place delivers.  Excellent kitchen items (roast duck with fois gras O My Dog!!) Best of all are the reasonable prices.  Ambiance is less important than food for me so if you want good eats in an non fancy setting check it out.,5.0
2013,"In order to enjoy Kirako you need to come hungry and you need to order lots of different dishes. But don't come here seeking sushi because they don't serve it. This is a tapas bar so the menu is extensive but the portions can be small. However, there are some truly unique items to be had here. The corn fritters are by far a signature dish that shouldn't be missed and their black cod was incredibly delicious but the portion was miniscule considering it costs $14. But Kirakus is a great place to order beer by the pitcher and sit with friends while sampling a wide variety of Japanese dishes. It won't be a cheap evening out but you're sure to have a good time and great food. Probably the biggest down side to Kiraku is it's size, it's quite a tiny (albeit cozy) place. Because of this, it's not good for large groups and your wait for a table is likely to be in the 45 minutes to 1 hr range. They ~DO~ take reservations but as another reviewer has mentioned, you'll need to spend at least  $30 per person, but don't worry, that's easily accomplished here at Kiraku. If you've never been here, add it to your list of places to try.",4.0
