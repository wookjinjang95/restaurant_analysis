        About Me..
      </div>
      <h1 class="header">Short Introduction</h1>
      <img src="images/profile.jpg" class="profile-img">
      <p>Hello and thank you for checking out my webpage. To introduce myself, my name is Wookjin Jang and I am currently
        working as a software engineer or robotic process automation developer in IT industry. To talk about this page,
        I want to share what I believe "data science" to everyone whether you are a local business owner, teacher, students,
        or anyone who doesn't know what data science is.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz (Go SLUGS!) with double majors in Computer Science, and
        Technology & Information Management. I took courses in artificial intelligence, machine
        learning, data visualization, natural language processing, network programming, advanced algrotihm, and etc.
        Lastly but not least, I am a developer for this website and also a data mining automation engineer for data visualization
        within this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduation, I start seeking my career towards aritificial intellignece and machine learning. My first path in my career
        started with a fulltime position as Robotic Process Automation Developer. Now, I am seeking different paths such as frontend developer,
        and data analytics. If you want my details, I will be attaching my resume.   <a href="other_files/wookjin-jang.pdf">resume.pdf</a>
      </p>
      <h1 class="header-purpose">Purpose</h1>
      <p>
        If you are not from silicon valley or don't have a technological background, you are definitely wondering what is data science?
        In <a href="about.html">about section</a> tab, you can learn a short description of what data science is. If not, I will explain
        what data science is here also.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header">Data Science</h1>
      <u>What is data?</u>
      <p>
        Data is everywhere. Everything you do, you leave behind digital trace or data. Everything you buy, download, see, anything that
        is happening on a digital machine will eventually convert to data. Your bank account contains data about how much you are spending,
        your credit score, social security number, and amount of money that you are saving.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Northeastern University article, the total amount of data in the world is 4.4 zettabytes in 2013, and researchers
        are predicting that there will be 44 zettabytes by 2020. If that doesn't sound crazy to you, let me visually represent what those
        numbers are. Remember that average computer has arond 1 terabytes of data, this is not including small devices. Now, 1 zettabytes
        will equal 1,000,000,000 terabytes!

      <u>What is data science?</u>
      <p>
        Now with this big data, data scientists will use algorithms and mathematics to analyze or solve problems. To see what data
        science can do or provide, you can visit <a href="about.html">here</a>. With data science, people invented artificial intelligence
        such as self-driving cars, facial recognition, predicting next mountain fire, and more. It is being used widely by big corporations
        and big companies with massive amount of data behind their servers.

      <h1 class="header">However..</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, data science is being used only by big corporations and companies to generate more revenue and profits. They hire both data scientists
        and business intelligence engineers to create insights and stories within the big data. Facebook, as an example, use machine learning or artificial
        intelligence to calculate what kind of advertisements will be shown to each individual users to generate maximum revenue as possible.

        Similar to other big companies, they are monitoring every users' data and increase their profits and revenues using A.I.
      </p>
      <div class="gb_title">My goal</div>
      <p>
        My goal is to make data analysis and data science affordable to everyone. It is not fair when advanced technology such like data science
        is only being used in big companies. I believe that any local business owners can bring benefits by using data analytics and machine learning
        in their daily lives.
